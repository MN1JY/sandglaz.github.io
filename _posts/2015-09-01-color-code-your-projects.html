<p>We're excited to announce that you can now color code your tasks based on which project they belong to. </p>
<p>"My Tasks" aggregates all your tasks from across multiple projects. Today, we added the ability to customize each project's color. This will automatically color code the tasks in your "My Tasks" for easy visualization of function.</p>
<p>Here's how "My Tasks" looks after I customized the colors of my projects. Notice how the labels are now colored. For example you can see that I set blue for my "Product Backlog" project.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/project-color-mytasks.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/project-color-mytasks.png" alt="project-color-mytasks" width="768" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3318" /></a></p>
<p>To set your project's color, go to the project's settings and select the color. That's all you need to do.</p>

<p>Sandglaz visualizes your task's priorities by mapping your sprints into columns â€” at a glance you can see what tasks need to be accomplished when. In addition you can drag and drop your tasks in the order of priority within the same sprint. Today's release adds colors as yet one more dimension to your visualization!</p>
<p>Start color coding your tasks now at <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com">Sandglaz</a>. </p>
