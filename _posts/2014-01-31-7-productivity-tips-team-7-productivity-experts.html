    tips seem to be everywhere these days. Do this to work smarter, do that to be

    truth on many levels for both teams and individuals. These productivity tips can
    bring value to you and your team. They can not only make you more productive,
    but also improve your whole outlook on work. </p><p>Here are some of those productivity
    tips, directly from some of the world'' most renowned productivity experts.</p><h2><a
    href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/#more-10297"
    target="_blank">Tim Ferriss</a>: focus on what matters</h2><p><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>
    best-selling author teaches us to focus on what really matters by dedicating a
    daily block of 2-3 hours to truly dedicate ourselves to those tasks that are truly
    important. Ferriss admits that he himself is sometimes haunted by <a title="5
    Types of Procrastinators" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-types-of-procrastinators/"
    target="_blank">procrastination</a>, as many of us are, especially when it comes
    to important tasks. But even when procrastination bites, focusing on only one
    important task can still lead you and your team members to great results: <span
    style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><blockquote><p>"This
    is the only way I can create big outcomes despite my never-ending impulse to procrastinate,
    nap, and otherwise fritter away my days with bullshit. If I have 10 important
    things to do in a day, it’s 100% certain nothing important will get done that
    day. On the other hand, I can usually handle 1 must-do item and block out my lesser
    behaviors for 2-3 hours a day.</p><p>It doesn’t take much to seem superhuman and
    appear “successful” to nearly everyone around you. In fact, you just need one
    rule: What you do is more important than how you do everything else, and doing
    something well does not make it important.” ~ Tim Ferriss </p></blockquote><h2>David
    Allen: change how you engage with the world</h2><p>There’s a lot to learn from
    GTD guru David Allen, but this tweet can especially resonate with team members.
    It reminds us that how we engage with the world in fact influences the way we
    perceive the world. It''s a really powerful concept that we all tend to forget
    from time to time, especially when work gets particularly <a title="How to handle
    stress more efficiently" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/handle-stress-efficiently/"
    target="_blank">stressful</a> and the stakes are high:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
    lang="en"><p>The world itself is not overwhelming. How we are engaged with it
    may well be.</p><p>— David Allen (@gtdguy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gtdguy/statuses/350285909377298433">June
    27, 2013</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=" http://timemanagementninja.com/2013/11/7-ways-a-positive-attitude-can-make-you-more-productive/"
    target="_blank">Craig Jarrow: approach work with a positive attitude </a></h2><p>The
    Time Management Ninja emphasized the importance of a positive attitude while approaching
    work. It''s hard to come to terms with this, but we can choose how we feel. Even
    forcing a smile can actually make us <a title="How smiling makes you happy" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/smiling-happy1.htm"
    target="_blank">feel happy</a>. In the same way, approaching work with a positive
    attitude will enable you and your team to get more done. Just make sure that your
    team members have what they need to access this positive attitude.</p><blockquote><p>"When
    you are faced with adversity, you can let your mood change for the worse or you
    can choose to look on the positive side of the situation.</p><p>The more positive
    your attitude, the more you can get done." ~ Craig Jarrow</p></blockquote><h2>Julie
    Morgenstern: follow your own right way</h2><p>Many people forget this about their
    own and their team''s productivity techniques. Getting stuck on doing the “right”
    thing often results in not doing <strong><em>the right thing for you</em></strong>.
    Both you and your team need the flexibility to adapt productivity techniques to
    your own lifestyles, personalities and way of working. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
    lang="en"><p>There is no "right" way to manage your time. Organizing systems work
    long term if they are based around who you are.</p><p>— Julie Morgenstern (@JulieMorgenstrn)
    <a href="https://twitter.com/JulieMorgenstrn/statuses/428943832148082689">January
    30, 2014</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href="http://www.morefreetimezone.com/small-business-success/core-values/#more-1709"
    target="_blank">Andrea Feinberg: create the right company values</a></h2><p>This
    one might not be so obviously related to productivity at first. But your company''s
    values define what your team is working for and what it''s working towards. Wrongly
    defined company values </p><blockquote><p>“...values now are too often platitudes
    and tag lines that have little meaning to the company’s management or employees.
    Even worse, arbitrary values chosen by executives often conflict with the real
    goals of the company and are used in an attempt to motivate confused employees.”
    ~ Andrea Feinberg</p></blockquote><h2><a href="http://nmhouston.com/refocus-now/page/2/"
    target="_blank">Natalie M. Houston: embrace not doing</a></h2><p>Sometimes, not
    doing can be the answer to doing more. It seems to be a paradox, but when we take
    the time to relax and recharge our batteries we are in fact able to accomplish
    a lot more. And, as Houston points out, it can be beneficial to simply take a
    break from our tight <a title="Create the to-do list that you’ll actually get
    done" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/create-a-to-do-list-that-youll-get-done/"
    target="_blank">to-do lists</a>. </p><blockquote><p>Not doing is so important.
    Not just in terms of sleep and rest, but to have time that isn’t pre-planned or
    layered with expectations. If you’re feeling like your task lists are running
    your life, try creating some small pockets of time — even just 15 minutes here,
    half an hour somewhere else — for simply not doing. If not doing seems too scary,
    then set aside that pocket of time for play or relaxation. Do whatever feels appealing
    right then, in the moment.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="http://tararobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reliability-manifesto.jpg"
    target="_blank">Tara Rodden Robinson: take time before answering ''yes''</a></h2><p>In
    her <em>Reliability Manifesto</em>, Tara Rodden Robinson emphasizes something
    that most of us don''t do enough: taking the time to think about what''s being
    asked from us before answering ''yes'' to someone''s request. In fact, many of
    us spread ourselves thin too often. Frankly, it''s hard to say ''no'' to the requests
    of a colleague that you genuinely want to help. But being truly reliable implies
    <em>not</em> spreading yourself too thin, so that you may be able to honour those
    requests. Take the time to truly understand what is being asked of you, and be
    upright about your abilities and potential time constraints. </p><blockquote><p>“Being
    able to speak a clear ‘yes’ requires knowing what is being asked of me. Therefore,
    I cultivate the space between requests and my response to them so I can examine
    what the request truly is." ~ Tara Rodden Robinson</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Feel
    free to adopt and adapt any or all of the above tips within your team. Then let
    us know how they''ve affected your productivity!  </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Are

If you’re feeling like your task lists are running your life, try creating some small pockets of time — even just 15 minutes here, half an hour somewhere else — for simply not doing. If not doing seems too scary, then set aside that pocket of time for play or relaxation. Do whatever feels appealing right then, in the moment.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://tararobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reliability-manifesto.jpg" target="_blank">Tara Rodden Robinson: take time before answering 'yes'</a></h2>
<p>In her <em>Reliability Manifesto</em>, Tara Rodden Robinson emphasizes something that most of us don't do enough: taking the time to think about what's being asked from us before answering 'yes' to someone's request. In fact, many of us spread ourselves thin too often. Frankly, it's hard to say 'no' to the requests of a colleague that you genuinely want to help. But being truly reliable implies <em>not</em> spreading yourself too thin, so that you may be able to honour those requests. Take the time to truly understand what is being asked of you, and be upright about your abilities and potential time constraints.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Being able to speak a clear ‘yes’ requires knowing what is being asked of me. Therefore, I cultivate the space between requests and my response to them so I can examine what the request truly is." ~ Tara Rodden Robinson</p></blockquote>
