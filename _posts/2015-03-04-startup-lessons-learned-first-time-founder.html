    bit over four years, I decided to quit my cushy job leading a team at a Canadian
    bank and dive head first into the deep end of the start-up world. I knew that
    there was a lot to learn: Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, and pushing the limits of
    web development. It sounded ambitious but doable. The plan was to build a great
    product, and the world will come knocking. right? wrong!</p><p>As many first-time
    founders (hopefully) discover, the amount of work and learning a start-up needs
    dwarfs anything else they have done. What''s even more challenging, you have to
    fill many different roles at different times and constantly step outside your
    comfort zone. I not only learned an insane amount about development, product design,
    marketing, SEO, team building and hiring, I learned even more on a personal level.
    I learned how to be productive without getting stressed and how to balance the
    life of an entrepreneur with all my other interests. This post distills some of
    my learnings from my journey in the startup world.</p><h2>Build it and they won''t

    alt="34H" width="640" height="480" /></a></p><h4>Think small incremental improvements</h4><p>Ship
    early and ship often, but don''t ship crap. The core problem you are solving for
    your customer needs to be well executed and polished. To ship early, cut features
    not corners. These small daily and weekly changes amount to huge improvements
    when summed over a year.</p><h4>Keep it simple</h4><p>Before working on anything,
    think hard about what is the intended outcome, then find the simplest way of achieving
    that outcome. By simplest I mean as simple as possible but no more. Don''t cut
    corners.</p><blockquote><p>Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler
    —Albert Einstein</p></blockquote><p>Complex solutions to a problem are almost
    <em>never</em> right. They confuse your team, they confuse your customer, heck
    they confuse the future you. This applies to the user interface of your product,
    the algorithm you use to implement it, the business processes to support it, etc.
    When looking for a solution to a problem, find the most general and elegant solution.
    Solving a problem is the easy part, finding a simple solution to a problem is
    the hard part.</p><p>You''ll also know when you''ve found an elegant solution,
    you''ll end up eliminating a bunch of edge cases from your code, your product
    will be easier to explain and understand, and you''ll be very proud of it!</p><p>We
    keep our <a title="How we keep our product simple, stupid" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-we-keep-our-product-simple-stupid/">product,
    code, and processes simple</a> at Sandglaz because we know from experience that
    building on top complex solutions results in more complexity. This complexity
    inevitably results in slowing us down. Embracing quality and simplicity allows
    us to do more faster everyday, to make better decisions, and to <a title="How
    we built a culture of embracing change" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/built-culture-embracing-change/">be
    responsive to change</a>.</p><h4>Have the courage to throw away work</h4>[caption

    Photo Credit: Raffaele Esposito - Flickr[/caption]<p>What''s worse than having
    to throw three weeks of work on a feature? Working a few more weeks on it to find
    out that no one cares about it, or that it is confusing your customers. So how
    do you avoid doing that? Well, you can''t completely eliminate it, but you can
    reduce how much it stings. <a title="Demystifying the 80/20 rule: How to apply
    it to workplace productivity" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/demystifying-8020-rule-apply-workplace-productivity/">Build
    the risky part of your work first</a> and assess before continuing. You''ll be
    a lot more <a title="Why businesses that embrace change win" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/businesses-embrace-change-win/">responsive
    to change</a> and able to throw away work that doesn''t measure up</p><h4>It will
    take a lot more than a beautiful product to succeed</h4><p>There is no such thing
    as an overnight success, it takes a lot—and I mean A LOT—of hard work to be successful
    as a start-up. Building a killer product that is easy to use is only a baby step
    towards success.</p><blockquote><p>A startup''s success is dependent on having
    a well executed product that solves a pain for <strong>a set of customers</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Notice
    the bolded part. The beautiful product is only part of the equation. Find and
    refine who your customer is before spending too much time building that beautiful
    product. Don''t solve a problem no one cares about.</p><h2>Others can''t educate
    you on why your product is great</h2><h4>Be confident</h4><p><img class="alignnone
    size-large wp-image-3067" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nomad-1024x756.jpeg"
    alt="nomad" width="640" height="473" /></p><p>As a first time founder, it is easy
    to think that an adviser or expert can provide you with definitive judgement on
    what will work and won''t work for your business. The reality? Entrepreneurs and
    investors are a confident and egotistical bunch. Most will tell you their opinion
    as fact. It is your job to learn how to distill the feedback and advice to something
    useful to you.</p><p>You (should) know your business and customer better than
    most, so you should be able to explain your product benefits and the problem(s)
    it solves better than most. Do it confidently, and others will also be confident
    in you.</p><h4>Be Boring</h4><p>Being overly creative in explaining your product
    to customers or pitching it to investors will only confuse and distract them.
    Explain your product in a boring way: no need to talk about everything that''s
    different immediately. Just say enough to get people curious to explore, then
    allow them to peel more and more layers of awesomeness.</p><h4>Be Humble</h4><p>Being
    confident doesn''t mean being arrogant and thinking you are the only one that
    gets it. Listen to feedback from you customers and learn from the experience of
    others.</p><h4>Don''t do investor development</h4><p>Unless investors are your
    customers, the only person you should be getting product feedback from is your
    customer.</p><h4>Promote from day one, and never stop</h4><p>If you have the world''s
    best product, no one will buy it unless they know about it. Don''t wait for the
    perfect moment, or the perfect strategy. You need the enough people using your
    perfect product to provide actual feedback you can start iterating from.</p><p> </p><h2>The
    customer is (almost) right</h2><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/83.jpg"><img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3060" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/83-1024x678.jpg"
    alt="83" width="640" height="424" /></a></p><h4>Listen to feedback and iterate</h4><p>Customer
    feedback is what takes your product from good to great and helps you solve more
    of their problems better. Make it easy for customers to provide feedback and ask
    for their feedback regularly. At Sandglaz, we know many of our customers by name
    and talk to them regularly. We have pictures and descriptions of our customers
    hanging on the wall in the office. The intimate understanding of our customers
    and their needs guides every decision we make.</p><h4>Don''t follow the feedback</h4><p>When
    a customer is asking you for feature x, or an option to toggle on/off a part of
    your interface, do not go and implement it. Ask more questions and understand
    very well what is the actual problem they are facing. A feature request is a problem
    under disguise.</p><h4>Define your customer</h4><p>Define your customer carefully.
    Everyone cannot be a customer—at least not early on. It is next to impossible
    to build a great product for everyone on the first try. Build a product that a
    small group of people love, and then slowly generalize it to more markets. Why?
    If your product is targeting lawyers, you have to speak their languages to show
    them that you understand their problems and that your product is solving their
    problems. Trying to please everyone at the same time results in no-one being happy.</p><h2>A
    tired mind doesn''t make (good) decisions</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-large
    wp-image-3065" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/150H-1024x683.jpg"
    alt="150H" width="640" height="427" /></p><h4>Your startup ≠ you life</h4><p>In
    my first year at Sandglaz, my co-founder and I worked all the time. Day, night,
    weekend. It didn''t matter. The rush and excitement of the startup kept us working.
    However, I started noticing that I was making more mistakes. And that it was taking
    me longer to notice when I''m stuck in a dead end. So some changes were needed
    to be more efficient with my time.</p><h4>Burst the startup bubble</h4><p><img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3066" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/water-bomb-549091_1280-1024x670.jpg"
    alt="water-bomb-549091_1280" width="640" height="419" /></p><p>This is probably
    the most enlightening change. Hang out with people who don''t understand the startup
    world. It will force you to talk about other interests (if you don''t have other
    interests, it will encourage you to develop some). You will avoid seeing the world
    only through the point of view of your startup.</p><h4>Recharge your mind</h4><p>Your
    <a title="Why does interrupted sleep ruin our productivity?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sleep-deprivation-hurting-workplace/">mind
    and body need sleep</a> to recharge, and all you''re doing by cutting on sleep
    is making yourself inefficient. So sleep whenever you feel sleepy (even <a title="The
    case for napping at work [infographic]" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-case-for-napping-at-work/">at
    work</a>), and work more efficiently when you are awake.</p><p>Make sure you get
    quality sleep as well. Institute time away from electronics, email etc. (especially
    before bedtime), and get regular exposure to daylight to have a well rested productive
    mind.</p><h4>Stay healthy</h4><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/healthy-habits.jpg"><img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3056" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/healthy-habits-1024x683.jpg"
    alt="healthy habits" width="640" height="427" /></a></p><p>There is a stereotype
    of startup founders living of instant noodles and beer. While that makes great
    articles and movies, it is the worst thing you can do to your productivity: <a
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/">your
    energy levels will plummet</a>, and you won''t produce nearly as much.</p><p>Eat
    well, exercise regularly and sleep well to operate at peak efficiency.</p><h2>Design
    your life processes</h2><h4>Create a routine</h4><p>Every decision you make in
    day reduces your <a title="How to improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/">cognitive
    stamina</a> for the day. So be merciless in eliminating the unimportant decisions
    you have to make in a day (e.g. What to wear? When to start work? Where to work
    today?).</p><h4>Hack your environment</h4><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/no-car.jpg"><img
    class="alignnone wp-image-3054 size-large" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/no-car-1024x683.jpg"
    alt="no car" width="640" height="427" /></a></p><p>When you are tired (from making
    too many decisions in your day), you default to easy choices. So eliminate unhealthy
    choices or make healthy choices the ONLY choice available.</p><p>For example,
    I no longer have a car, so I don''t have to actively make the decision to walk
    or take the subway somewhere. Both are more active and healthier decisions that
    driving. We also only stock the office with healthy snacks. This way if you are
    looking for a quick snack, the easy choice is the healthy snack.</p><h4>Pay for
    services not things</h4><p>I look for ways to give me more time to spend on the
    important things in my life. For example, at home I pay for house cleaning, Amazon
    family subscription and grocery delivery in order to automate parts of my personal
    life that can be automated.</p><p>Same thing applies at Sandglaz. We pay for <a
    href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a>
    to save time and resources on DevOps and social media management.</p><h4>Step
    away</h4><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/airbaloon.jpg"><img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3057" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/airbaloon-1024x683.jpg"
    alt="airbaloon" width="640" height="427" /></a>Take time <a title="I took a vacation
    so my team can thrive. You can too." href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/i-took-a-vacation-so-my-team-can-thrive/">away
    from work</a>. It will allow you to see the big picture better. You''ll return
    with a fresh perspective and you''ll be able to improve how you and your company
    works.</p><p><strong>What is your favorite learning from your business? Share

<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/34H.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3063" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/34H-1024x768.jpg" alt="34H" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<h4>Think small incremental improvements</h4>
<p>Ship early and ship often, but don't ship crap. The core problem you are solving for your customer needs to be well executed and polished. To ship early, cut features not corners. These small daily and weekly changes amount to huge improvements when summed over a year.</p>
<h4>Keep it simple</h4>
<p>Before working on anything, think hard about what is the intended outcome, then find the simplest way of achieving that outcome. By simplest I mean as simple as possible but no more. Don't cut corners.</p>
<blockquote><p>Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler —Albert Einstein</p></blockquote>
<p>Complex solutions to a problem are almost <em>never</em> right. They confuse your team, they confuse your customer, heck they confuse the future you. This applies to the user interface of your product, the algorithm you use to implement it, the business processes to support it, etc. When looking for a solution to a problem, find the most general and elegant solution. Solving a problem is the easy part, finding a simple solution to a problem is the hard part.</p>
<p>You'll also know when you've found an elegant solution, you'll end up eliminating a bunch of edge cases from your code, your product will be easier to explain and understand, and you'll be very proud of it!</p>
<p>We keep our <a title="How we keep our product simple, stupid" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-we-keep-our-product-simple-stupid/">product, code, and processes simple</a> at Sandglaz because we know from experience that building on top complex solutions results in more complexity. This complexity inevitably results in slowing us down. Embracing quality and simplicity allows us to do more faster everyday, to make better decisions, and to <a title="How we built a culture of embracing change" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/built-culture-embracing-change/">be responsive to change</a>.</p>
<h4>Have the courage to throw away work</h4>

<p>What's worse than having to throw three weeks of work on a feature? Working a few more weeks on it to find out that no one cares about it, or that it is confusing your customers. So how do you avoid doing that? Well, you can't completely eliminate it, but you can reduce how much it stings. <a title="Demystifying the 80/20 rule: How to apply it to workplace productivity" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/demystifying-8020-rule-apply-workplace-productivity/">Build the risky part of your work first</a> and assess before continuing. You'll be a lot more <a title="Why businesses that embrace change win" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/businesses-embrace-change-win/">responsive to change</a> and able to throw away work that doesn't measure up</p>
<h4>It will take a lot more than a beautiful product to succeed</h4>
<p>There is no such thing as an overnight success, it takes a lot—and I mean A LOT—of hard work to be successful as a start-up. Building a killer product that is easy to use is only a baby step towards success.</p>
<blockquote><p>A startup's success is dependent on having a well executed product that solves a pain for <strong>a set of customers</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the bolded part. The beautiful product is only part of the equation. Find and refine who your customer is before spending too much time building that beautiful product. Don't solve a problem no one cares about.</p>
<h2>Others can't educate you on why your product is great</h2>
<h4>Be confident</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3067" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/nomad-1024x756.jpeg" alt="nomad" width="640" height="473" /></p>
<p>As a first time founder, it is easy to think that an adviser or expert can provide you with definitive judgement on what will work and won't work for your business. The reality? Entrepreneurs and investors are a confident and egotistical bunch. Most will tell you their opinion as fact. It is your job to learn how to distill the feedback and advice to something useful to you.</p>
<p>You (should) know your business and customer better than most, so you should be able to explain your product benefits and the problem(s) it solves better than most. Do it confidently, and others will also be confident in you.</p>
<h4>Be Boring</h4>
<p>Being overly creative in explaining your product to customers or pitching it to investors will only confuse and distract them. Explain your product in a boring way: no need to talk about everything that's different immediately. Just say enough to get people curious to explore, then allow them to peel more and more layers of awesomeness.</p>
<h4>Be Humble</h4>
<p>Being confident doesn't mean being arrogant and thinking you are the only one that gets it. Listen to feedback from you customers and learn from the experience of others.</p>
<h4>Don't do investor development</h4>
<p>Unless investors are your customers, the only person you should be getting product feedback from is your customer.</p>
<h4>Promote from day one, and never stop</h4>
<p>If you have the world's best product, no one will buy it unless they know about it. Don't wait for the perfect moment, or the perfect strategy. You need the enough people using your perfect product to provide actual feedback you can start iterating from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The customer is (almost) right</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/83.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3060" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/83-1024x678.jpg" alt="83" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<h4>Listen to feedback and iterate</h4>
<p>Customer feedback is what takes your product from good to great and helps you solve more of their problems better. Make it easy for customers to provide feedback and ask for their feedback regularly. At Sandglaz, we know many of our customers by name and talk to them regularly. We have pictures and descriptions of our customers hanging on the wall in the office. The intimate understanding of our customers and their needs guides every decision we make.</p>
<h4>Don't follow the feedback</h4>
<p>When a customer is asking you for feature x, or an option to toggle on/off a part of your interface, do not go and implement it. Ask more questions and understand very well what is the actual problem they are facing. A feature request is a problem under disguise.</p>
<h4>Define your customer</h4>
<p>Define your customer carefully. Everyone cannot be a customer—at least not early on. It is next to impossible to build a great product for everyone on the first try. Build a product that a small group of people love, and then slowly generalize it to more markets. Why? If your product is targeting lawyers, you have to speak their languages to show them that you understand their problems and that your product is solving their problems. Trying to please everyone at the same time results in no-one being happy.</p>
<h2>A tired mind doesn't make (good) decisions</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3065" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/150H-1024x683.jpg" alt="150H" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<h4>Your startup ≠ you life</h4>
<p>In my first year at Sandglaz, my co-founder and I worked all the time. Day, night, weekend. It didn't matter. The rush and excitement of the startup kept us working. However, I started noticing that I was making more mistakes. And that it was taking me longer to notice when I'm stuck in a dead end. So some changes were needed to be more efficient with my time.</p>
<h4>Burst the startup bubble</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3066" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/water-bomb-549091_1280-1024x670.jpg" alt="water-bomb-549091_1280" width="640" height="419" /></p>
<p>This is probably the most enlightening change. Hang out with people who don't understand the startup world. It will force you to talk about other interests (if you don't have other interests, it will encourage you to develop some). You will avoid seeing the world only through the point of view of your startup.</p>
<h4>Recharge your mind</h4>
<p>Your <a title="Why does interrupted sleep ruin our productivity?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sleep-deprivation-hurting-workplace/">mind and body need sleep</a> to recharge, and all you're doing by cutting on sleep is making yourself inefficient. So sleep whenever you feel sleepy (even <a title="The case for napping at work [infographic]" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-case-for-napping-at-work/">at work</a>), and work more efficiently when you are awake.</p>
<p>Make sure you get quality sleep as well. Institute time away from electronics, email etc. (especially before bedtime), and get regular exposure to daylight to have a well rested productive mind.</p>
<h4>Stay healthy</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/healthy-habits.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3056" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/healthy-habits-1024x683.jpg" alt="healthy habits" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>There is a stereotype of startup founders living of instant noodles and beer. While that makes great articles and movies, it is the worst thing you can do to your productivity: <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/">your energy levels will plummet</a>, and you won't produce nearly as much.</p>
<p>Eat well, exercise regularly and sleep well to operate at peak efficiency.</p>
<h2>Design your life processes</h2>
<h4>Create a routine</h4>
<p>Every decision you make in day reduces your <a title="How to improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/">cognitive stamina</a> for the day. So be merciless in eliminating the unimportant decisions you have to make in a day (e.g. What to wear? When to start work? Where to work today?).</p>
<h4>Hack your environment</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/no-car.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3054 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/no-car-1024x683.jpg" alt="no car" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>When you are tired (from making too many decisions in your day), you default to easy choices. So eliminate unhealthy choices or make healthy choices the ONLY choice available.</p>
<p>For example, I no longer have a car, so I don't have to actively make the decision to walk or take the subway somewhere. Both are healthier decisions than driving. We also only stock the office with healthy snacks. This way if you are looking for a quick snack, the easy choice is the healthy snack.</p>
<h4>Pay for services not things</h4>
<p>I look for ways to give me more time to spend on the important things in my life. For example, at home I pay for house cleaning, Amazon family subscription and grocery delivery in order to automate parts of my personal life that can be automated.</p>
<p>Same thing applies at Sandglaz. We pay for <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> to save time and resources on DevOps and social media management.</p>
<h4>Step away</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/airbaloon.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3057" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/airbaloon-1024x683.jpg" alt="airbaloon" width="640" height="427" /></a>Take time <a title="I took a vacation so my team can thrive. You can too." href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/i-took-a-vacation-so-my-team-can-thrive/">away from work</a>. It will allow you to see the big picture better. You'll return with a fresh perspective and you'll be able to improve how you and your company works.</p>
