  _yoast_wpseo_title: How to break down goals into tasks - Sandglaz Blog
  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: Ambitious goals are motivating at first, but they can become
    intimidating if you can&#39;t reach them. That’s why you need to break down goals
    into tasks.

    a map of milestones </b></h2><p>Goals can usually be divided into milestones.
    If you’re running a marathon, your milestones might be:</p><ul><li>jog for thirty
    minutes</li><li>run 5k in thirty minutes</li><li>run total weekly distance of
    15k</li><li>run total weekly distance of 30k</li></ul><p>… and so on. Milestones
    are still big steps, but they help you think of your goals in terms of what you
    need to achieve them. You can begin to grasp what is necessary to achieve each
    milestone, and what you need to get there.</p><h2><b>Come up with a task list</b></h2><p>Now
    that you have a map of your milestones that you want to achieve, you can come
    up with a task list. You don’t need to map out your whole goal. <strong>Start

    your tasks actionable by always starting them with a verb, and make sure you really
    are clear about what each task entails. If any task is still vague, then break
    them down even further.</p><h2><b>What kind of support do you need to achieve
    each step? </b></h2><p>Before you begin working away on each task, try to anticipate

    want to do some research on what are the best running shoes for you.</p><p><span
    style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Figuring out what is needed
    to complete each task is even more important within the workplace, as team members
    often depend on one another. If one team member does not have the tools to complete
    one task, the whole team will be set back. </span></p><p><span style="line-height:
    1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Think of all the practical things, whether it’s
    knowledge or professional help, that you will need to complete each task. Start
    making plans in advance to make sure that what you need will be there when you
    need it. </span></p><h2><b>Create a timeline for your tasks </b></h2><p>Once you
    have your task list, it’s time to create a timeline for your tasks.</p><p>The
    timeline will allow you to see what needs to happen for a task to begin, and what
    tasks can happen alongside each other. But this does not refer to multitasking!
    For example, beginning your nutrition plan and jogging three times a week can
    happen alongside each other, but you need to buy your running shoes first.</p><p>Creating
    a timeline for your tasks will help you see your goals in a more achievable light,
    and will also help you be more efficient about how you spend your time.</p><h2><b>Work
    toward completing each task </b></h2><p>You have your goals, you have your milestones,
    and you have your tasks. Now it’s time to start working away on each task.</p><p>The
    big advantage of breaking down your goals into tasks is that it creates small,
    actionable and achievable steps for you to take. There is no doubt that you can
    complete each individual task, which gives you the confidence to move swiftly
    toward your goal.</p><p>But imagine standing at the foot of a mountain and looking
    up at the distant summit. If you look up at the summit, you might feel overwhelmed
    by how much you need to hike. You might even start doubting if you’re able to
    climb the mountain at all. Now, if you look at the first camp, a few hundred meters
    above where you’re standing, getting there will probably feel a lot more achievable
    than climbing the mountain.</p><p>When you break down goals into tasks, you break
    down what might seem impossible into a sequence of doable steps.</p><p>You can
    sometimes take a peak at the summit, imagine yourself there, remind yourself why
    you want to get there in the first place. But keep your eyes firmly on the next
    camp and walk steadily toward it, knowing that’s what will get you to the top
    of the mountain.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>";s:3:"url";s:25:"http://blog.sandglaz.com/";}}'
