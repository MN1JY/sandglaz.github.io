<p>Some say learning from your mistakes is valuable, but I say it's more valuable to learn from others' mistakes and from your success.

<p>Another great one from <a title="Will Yakowicz on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/WillYakowicz" target="_blank">Will Yakowicz</a> with advice from Alan Ennis, former CEO of Revlon who resigned earlier this month. Advice worth considering from a man who went as far as trying out Revlon's products (make-up and nail polish, that is) on himself, in order to identify with his target consumers (sometimes even on public transportation, we're led to believe).</p>
<h2><a title="A better way to group brainstorm" href="http://lifehacker.com/a-better-way-to-group-brainstorm-1445054503" target="_blank">A Better Way to Group Brainstorm</a></h2>
