    Kamprad and Richard Branson were entrepreneurs creating products that would revolutionize
    the world. Read more about their startup tips:";s:7:"content";s:9339:"<p>Today,
    IKEA operates over 300 stores in 40+ countries.</p><p>Apple has over 80,000 employees.</p><p>And
    the Virgin Group is made up of over 400 companies.</p><p>These three companies
    are amongst the biggest in the world today. They are what most startups hope to
    one day become: experts in their field, with a clear vision and the desire to
    constantly evolve.</p><p>They also have remarkable leaders who had a vision to
    create something life-altering. Ingvar Kamprad started his first business when
    he was only five years old, selling matchboxes for a profit. Steve Jobs, at the
    ripe old age of 12, called up Bill Hewlett asking for spare parts for a computer
    and subsequently landed a summer job at HP. Sixteen-year-old Richard Branson had
    a poor academic record but a terrific ability to connect with others.</p><p>What
    they all had in common was a desire to constantly seize opportunities. Shaping
    their companies in line with a vision that revealed the depths of their entrepreneurial
    spirit, they eventually created a legacy that revolutionized the ways people work,
    live, and entertain themselves.</p><p>Let’s take a look at their early days, before
    they made the breakthrough that made them what they are today:</p><h2><b>What
    Ingvar Kamprad can teach us from IKEA’s early days</b></h2><p>Today’s IKEA bears
    little resemblance to the IKEA that Ingvar Kamprad founded in 1943. Back then,
    it was a mail-order company that sold everything from pens to watches to furniture
    to cards. It was in 1952 that Kamprad decided that IKEA should <a href="http://blog.trejdify.com/2012/08/lessons-learned-ikea-startup.html">focus
    only on furniture and interior decoration</a>. It took one more decade to decide
    that IKEA would sell mainly through large physical stores, not mail-order.</p><p>The
    lesson here? After testing a series of different strategies, Kamprad decided to
    <b>focus on one thing only</b>. He found his niche and then cut away all that
    was superfluous and not in line with his strategy.</p><p>The result is the stores
    we are familiar with today - full of endless exhibits, model kitchens and bedrooms
    and living rooms, quirky product names and tasty Swedish meatballs (IKEA doesn’t
    sell you discounted food just because they’re nice. They do it so that you stay
    in their store longer).</p><p>The second lesson to learn from Ingvar Kamprad is
    <b>practice what you preach</b>. IKEA was founded on the basis of making well-designed,
    affordable furniture available to the everyday person. This philosophy of affordability,
    efficiency and simplicity is one that Kamprad has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-559487/He-lives-bungalow-flies-easyJet-dries-times-year--man-founded-Ikea-worth-pound-15bn.html">embraced
    throughout his life</a>.</p><p>Even as an 85 year old multibillionaire, he still
    flies economy, encourages his staff to dress casually, stays in cheap hotels,
    and drives an old Volvo. IKEA’s culture is one of no-nonsense, cost awareness,
    and treating employees well. The company has very few allegations of poor labour
    practices, bad environmental policies, or arrogant customer service.</p><p><b>Fun
    fact:</b> On the weekend, people are twice as likely to go to IKEA as to church
    in the United Kingdom.</p><p><b>When Apple was a shop in Jobs’ parents’ garage</b></p><p>In
    1975, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak set up shop in Job’s parents’ garage. They
    had 1,350 dollars in capital, which they made from Jobs selling his Volkswagen
    microbus and Wozniak selling his Hewlett-Packard calculator.</p><p>In those days,
    very few people had access to a computer. Programming - done on punch cards -
    was extremely cumbersome and time consuming. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197538"
    target="_blank">Home computers did not yet exist</a>.</p><p>“We started out to
    get a computer in the hands of everyday people, and we succeeded beyond our wildest
    dreams.” - Steve Jobs</p><p>In brief, they wanted to build the best thing they
    could build. Wozniak and Jobs’ vision for a computer accessible to the everyday
    man sparked the PC revolution and made Apple the icon it is today.</p><p><b>One
    of the most important things Apple will teach us</b>: For every product Apple
    designed, Jobs wanted to make something that was practical and beautiful at the
    same time. He didn’t only want a product people would use, he wanted a product
    people would <i>love</i>. This attention to aesthetic detail is what set Apple
    apart from competitors like IBM and Microsoft. Jobs explains his passion for making
    beautiful products in the following passage:</p><blockquote><p>“When you’re a
    carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece
    of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall. You’ll know it’s there,
    so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood. For you to sleep well at night,
    the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”</p></blockquote><p>For
    Jobs, every tiny aspect of the design had to be just right. If a product was functional
    but not beautiful, that wasn’t good enough. It could <i>always</i> be both.</p><p>The
    <b>second lesson</b> Jobs has to teach us is: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2010/id20100610_525759.htm"
    target="_blank">embrace a startup culture, even when you’re no longer a startup</a>.</p><p>As
    a company grows in size, it’s easy for <a title="Why lateral communication is
    good for startups" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-benefits-of-lateral-communication/">hierarchies
    to develop</a> that hinder easy exchange of ideas and stifle innovation.</p><p>However
    Apple, despite its thousands of employees, still works with a minimal bureaucracy
    and takes pains to respect its employees by promoting their personal development.
    Also, like in its early days, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/8-management-lessons-i-learned-working-at-apple-2011-8?op=1"
    target="_blank">Apple is still run by engineers</a>. Most product teams are small,
    and many product managers have an engineering background.</p><p>The result? There’s
    not the typical division between managers and code monkeys, and managers have
    a real understanding of the technology involved.</p><p><b>Fun fact: </b>Jobs would
    constantly be trying out different diets, learning at a young age how to reach
    euphoria and ecstasy by fasting. He once <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-food-weirdnesses-fasts-apple-and-carrot-diets-fruit-smoothie-diets/"
    target="_blank">ate so many carrots</a> that he turned orange.</p><p><b>Richard
    Branson: not the biggest, but the best</b></p><p>The Virgin Group today consists
    of more than 400 companies. Back in the late 1960s, charismatic Richard Branson
    was struggling in school, dropped out, and founded the magazine <i>The Student</i>.
    His old headmaster, Robert Drayson, said that he would either end up in prison
    or become a millionaire.</p><p>As it turns out, Drayson was right. Branson made
    his first million in 1973.</p><p><b>Richard Branson’s lesson to entrepreneurs</b>
    is to <a href="http://www.incomediary.com/15-lessons-from-richard-branson" target="_blank">diversify</a>.After
    founding <i>The Student</i>, which advertised popular records, Branson went on
    to start a mail-order record business in 1970. A year or so later, he opened up
    a record store. In 1972, he launched the record label Virgin Records. One of Virgin
    Records’ very first releases, Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield, is what earned Branson
    his first million. The Virgin Group has now expanded into airlines, green energy,
    mobile phones, even space travel.</p><p>By diversifying into complementary industries,
    Branson created a powerful infrastructure to reinforce his various businesses.
    As the owner of a magazine, several record stores, a record label, and a nightclub,
    it became very easy to promote for example a new up-and-coming artist signed to
    Virgin Records.</p><p>So why didn’t he just provide all these services under one
    massive company?</p><p>Because big companies don’t always work better. “<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/15-small-business-lessons-from-richard-branson-1/"
    target="_blank">Small is beautiful</a>”, said Branson. Smaller companies can stay
    more nimble and customer focused. Virgin Records is far from the biggest in the
    industry but still managed to attract legendary artists like the Rolling Stones.
    Virgin Airlines has only 37 planes, not 700+ like its competitors, but offers
    cool in-flight services like an onboard bar, massages, and flexible food ordering
    services. Who said flying isn’t fun?</p><p>In the end, Branson thinks that given
    the choice, it is always beneficial to spin off a company into a second, smaller
    company (like he did with Virgin Atlantic and Virgin America). When you’re smaller,
    it’s easier to uphold a cheeky, inquisitive company culture. And after all, Branson
    wasn’t out to be the biggest; he was out to be the best.</p><p><b>Fun fact:</b>
    Branson once tried to circumnavigate the globe in a hot air balloon.</p><p><b><i>Which
    of these three business leaders do you identify with? Have they influenced the

Sixteen-year-old Richard Branson had a poor academic record but a terrific ability to connect with others.</p>
<p>What they all had in common was a desire to constantly seize opportunities. Shaping their companies in line with a vision that revealed the depths of their entrepreneurial spirit, they eventually created a legacy that revolutionized the ways people work, live, and entertain themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at their early days, before they made the breakthrough that made them what they are today:</p>
<h2><b>What Ingvar Kamprad can teach us from IKEA’s early days</b></h2>
<p>Today’s IKEA bears little resemblance to the IKEA that Ingvar Kamprad founded in 1943. Back then, it was a mail-order company that sold everything from pens to watches to furniture to cards. It was in 1952 that Kamprad decided that IKEA should <a href="http://blog.trejdify.com/2012/08/lessons-learned-ikea-startup.html">focus only on furniture and interior decoration</a>. It took one more decade to decide that IKEA would sell mainly through large physical stores, not mail-order.</p>
<p>The lesson here? After testing a series of different strategies, Kamprad decided to <b>focus on one thing only</b>. He found his niche and then cut away all that was superfluous and not in line with his strategy.</p>
<p>The result is the stores we are familiar with today - full of endless exhibits, model kitchens and bedrooms and living rooms, quirky product names and tasty Swedish meatballs (IKEA doesn’t sell you discounted food just because they’re nice. They do it so that you stay in their store longer).</p>
<p>The second lesson to learn from Ingvar Kamprad is <b>practice what you preach</b>. IKEA was founded on the basis of making well-designed, affordable furniture available to the everyday person. This philosophy of affordability, efficiency and simplicity is one that Kamprad has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-559487/He-lives-bungalow-flies-easyJet-dries-times-year--man-founded-Ikea-worth-pound-15bn.html">embraced throughout his life</a>.</p>
<p>Even as an 85 year old multibillionaire, he still flies economy, encourages his staff to dress casually, stays in cheap hotels, and drives an old Volvo. IKEA’s culture is one of no-nonsense, cost awareness, and treating employees well. The company has very few allegations of poor labour practices, bad environmental policies, or arrogant customer service.</p>
<p><b>Fun fact:</b> On the weekend, people are twice as likely to go to IKEA as to church in the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2><b>When Apple was a shop in Jobs’ parents’ garage</b></h2>
<p>In 1975, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak set up shop in Job’s parents’ garage. They had 1,350 dollars in capital, which they made from Jobs selling his Volkswagen microbus and Wozniak selling his Hewlett-Packard calculator.</p>
<p>In those days, very few people had access to a computer. Programming - done on punch cards - was extremely cumbersome and time consuming. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197538" target="_blank">Home computers did not yet exist</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We started out to get a computer in the hands of everyday people, and we succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.” - Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>
<p>In brief, they wanted to build the best thing they could build. Wozniak and Jobs’ vision for a computer accessible to the everyday man sparked the PC revolution and made Apple the icon it is today.</p>
<p><b>One of the most important things Apple will teach us</b>: For every product Apple designed, Jobs wanted to make something that was practical and beautiful at the same time. He didn’t only want a product people would use, he wanted a product people would <i>love</i>. This attention to aesthetic detail is what set Apple apart from competitors like IBM and Microsoft. Jobs explains his passion for making beautiful products in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>“When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For Jobs, every tiny aspect of the design had to be just right. If a product was functional but not beautiful, that wasn’t good enough. It could <i>always</i> be both.</p>
<p>The <b>second lesson</b> Jobs has to teach us is: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2010/id20100610_525759.htm" target="_blank">embrace a startup culture, even when you’re no longer a startup</a>.</p>
<p>As a company grows in size, it’s easy for <a title="Why lateral communication is good for startups" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-benefits-of-lateral-communication/">hierarchies to develop</a> that hinder easy exchange of ideas and stifle innovation.</p>
<p>However Apple, despite its thousands of employees, still works with a minimal bureaucracy and takes pains to respect its employees by promoting their personal development. Also, like in its early days, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/8-management-lessons-i-learned-working-at-apple-2011-8?op=1" target="_blank">Apple is still run by engineers</a>. Most product teams are small, and many product managers have an engineering background.</p>
<p>The result? There’s not the typical division between managers and code monkeys, and managers have a real understanding of the technology involved.</p>
<p><b>Fun fact: </b>Jobs would constantly be trying out different diets, learning at a young age how to reach euphoria and ecstasy by fasting. He once <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-food-weirdnesses-fasts-apple-and-carrot-diets-fruit-smoothie-diets/" target="_blank">ate so many carrots</a> that he turned orange.</p>
<h2><b>Richard Branson: not the biggest, but the best</b></h2>
<p>The Virgin Group today consists of more than 400 companies. Back in the late 1960s, charismatic Richard Branson was struggling in school, dropped out, and founded the magazine <i>The Student</i>. His old headmaster, Robert Drayson, said that he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Drayson was right. Branson made his first million in 1973.</p>
<p><b>Richard Branson’s lesson to entrepreneurs</b> is to <a href="http://www.incomediary.com/15-lessons-from-richard-branson" target="_blank">diversify</a>. After founding <i>The Student</i>, which advertised popular records, Branson went on to start a mail-order record business in 1970. A year or so later, he opened up a record store. In 1972, he launched the record label Virgin Records. One of Virgin Records’ very first releases, Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield, is what earned Branson his first million. The Virgin Group has now expanded into airlines, green energy, mobile phones, even space travel.</p>
<p>By diversifying into complementary industries, Branson created a powerful infrastructure to reinforce his various businesses. As the owner of a magazine, several record stores, a record label, and a nightclub, it became very easy to promote for example a new up-and-coming artist signed to Virgin Records.</p>
<p>So why didn’t he just provide all these services under one massive company?</p>
<p>Because big companies don’t always work better. “<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/15-small-business-lessons-from-richard-branson-1/" target="_blank">Small is beautiful</a>”, said Branson. Smaller companies can stay more nimble and customer focused. Virgin Records is far from the biggest in the industry but still managed to attract legendary artists like the Rolling Stones. Virgin Airlines has only 37 planes, not 700+ like its competitors, but offers cool in-flight services like an onboard bar, massages, and flexible food ordering services. Who said flying isn’t fun?</p>
<p>In the end, Branson thinks that given the choice, it is always beneficial to spin off a company into a second, smaller company (like he did with Virgin Atlantic and Virgin America). When you’re smaller, it’s easier to uphold a cheeky, inquisitive company culture. And after all, Branson wasn’t out to be the biggest; he was out to be the best.</p>
<p><b>Fun fact:</b> Branson once tried to circumnavigate the globe in a hot air balloon.</p>
