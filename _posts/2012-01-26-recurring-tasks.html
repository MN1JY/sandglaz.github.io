<p>I'm happy to announce our most requested feature: Recurring Tasks!</p>
<p>You can set your tasks to repeat on daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis and get reminded before they are due. In addition to the basic schedules, we also support rich repeating schedules like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>repeat every weekday (excludes Saturday and Sunday)</li>
<li>repeat every 3 months on the 2nd Monday of the Month</li>
<li>repeat 6 weeks after completing the task</li>
</ul>
<h4>So how does this work?</h4>
<p>You can set your tasks to repeat after due date or after completion.</p>
<h3>Repeat after completion</h3>
<p>This will schedule your next task based on when you complete your current one. It's great when you don't have a strict schedule, and you don't want your tasks to accumulate if you don't complete them on time.</p>
<p><img alt="repeat weekly after completion" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></p>
<p>For example, if you have a task to 'Mow the Lawn' every 2 weeks, but you didn't get around to it until after 3 weeks, your next task will be 2 weeks after the time you completed it.</p>
<h3>Repeat after due date</h3>
<p>This will use the task's due date to create the next task. It is great when you want an exact schedule; e.g. a weekly team meeting at 1:30pm on Wednesdays.</p>
<p><img alt="repeat weekly on wednesdays" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></p>
<p>Monthly recurrences can be either on the day of the month or the day of the week. For example, you can set a task to repeat on the 10th of every month, or if it needs to happen on a specific weekday you can set it to repeat on the 2nd Tuesday of the month.</p>
<p><img alt="repeat monthly on day of week" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></p>
<p>Recurring tasks work on both Standard and Infinity grids, and are available on <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com/pages/pricing">all paid plans</a>.</p>
