    Quick capture is an essential component of <a title="7 productivity tips for your
    team from 7 productivity experts" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/7-productivity-tips-team-7-productivity-experts/"
    target="_blank">David Allen’s GTD methodology</a>, which works on the premise

    brain is like a computer - if you fill up the RAM with things you have to do,
    you’ll never get anything done” - David Allen</p></blockquote><p>If you’re focused
    on trying to remember what you have to do, instead of actually doing what you
    have to do, you spend a lot of energy on something that isn’t productive. Trying
    to remember so many things at once overtaxes the prefrontal cortex, weakens your
    decision-making ability, and takes up valuable space in the brain. You need to
    lighten your <a title="How to improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/"
    target="_blank">cognitive load</a> so that you actively work towards achieving
    your goals, not just remembering them.</p><p>Quick capture is the first step to
    making sure all your tasks get done and that nothing slips through the cracks.
    It’s a very simple concept: as soon as you have an idea, get it out of your head
    and into a trusted system. This trusted system can be a task management tool,
    a piece of paper, an online to do list, your phone - just make sure it’s a system
    that works for you.</p><p>Once you have your idea captured in a trusted system,
    you free up a ton of mental space. And now that everything is written down, you
    can go about prioritizing, organizing, and acting on your list without fear of
    forgetting anything.</p><h2><b>Be active, not passive, in allocating your time</b></h2><p>Victor
    Hugo once, said,</p><blockquote><p>“He who every morning plans the transaction
    of the day and follows out that plan, carries a thread that will guide him through
    the maze of the most of his busy life. But where no plan is laid, where the disposal
    of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incidence, chaos will soon reign”</p></blockquote><p>You
    need to organize your day so that you’re not just reacting to events, but actively
    planning what you’re going to do and how much time you’re going to spend on a
    task. Sort through <a title="How to improve your time management skills with the
