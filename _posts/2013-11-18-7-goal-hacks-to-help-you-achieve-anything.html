    </a>Our culture is so permeated by goal setting that you''d think by now we should

    title="The Zeigarnik effect: the scientific key to better work" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/zeigarnik-effect-scientific-key-to-better-work/"
    target="_blank">The Zeigarnik effect</a> tells us that unfinished tasks stay in
    the back of our minds, nagging at us. According to Bluma Zeigarnik''s research,
    people experience intrusive thoughts when a task is not completed. Because of
    this, you are more likely to get something done once you actually start doing
    it. When you''re just getting started on something, it might be useful to think
    of small steps you can take, so that you don''t feel intimidated by them. To achieve
    something, you simply need to get started somewhere… anywhere.</p><h1>Don''t get
    hung up on planning</h1><p>There''s a reason people suck at planning. <a title="Planning
    fallacy: why people suck at planning" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/people-suck-at-planning/"
    target="_blank">The planning fallacy</a> tells us that we often underestimate
    the time it takes us to get a task done, and we overestimate how long it takes
    others to get something done. What''s more, when it comes to our own planning,
    we don''t take into account past experiences that might indicate how long it will
    actually take to complete a task. It''s because our ego requires us to be optimistic
    about our predictions in order to protect our self-esteem. Besides, when we make
    plans we can become unresponsive to change, because abandoning the plan means
    we''re somehow failing.</p><p>This is not to say that you shouldn''t ever make
    plans. Make plans, but follow them loosely - keeping in mind that you will always
    learn more as you work your way toward your goal, which will most likely cause
    your plans to change.</p><h1>Find out why you procrastinate, then change your
    habits</h1><p>Knowing <a title="5 Types of Procrastinators" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-types-of-procrastinators/"
    target="_blank">what kind of procrastinator</a> you are means that you''ll be
    more likely to control your habits and less likely to abandon your goals. It will
    also mean that you''ll be able to do better work, since many procrastinators complete
    their work at the eleventh hour, but without achieving their full potential. Understanding
    why you leave tasks until the last minute will help you understand how you can
    alter your habits to avoid this.</p><h1>Prioritize goals and ditch busy work...</h1><p>Start
    thinking how to separate your daily grind from your big goals. On your to-do list,
    you might have everyday tasks, or chores, and major goals, the two co-existing
    side by side (think <a title="Check Email, Do Laundry, Learn Spanish" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/check-email-do-laundry-learn-spanish/"
    target="_blank">doing the laundry vs. learning Spanish</a>). The problem is that
    when you are faced with performing a relatively easy task or one where you need
    to put in more work, you will probably pick the first one.</p><p>Busy work is
    easier than slow, calculated work toward our goals. That''s because everyday tasks
    show immediate results, while taking small steps toward a major goal is not that
    tangible. And in some cases, the more we do, the more we realize how much there
    is left to get done. However, that''s no reason not to work toward our goals.
    It''s as simple as committing to place the tasks that will take us closer to our
    goals at the top of the list, both figuratively and literally.</p><h1>…but allow
    some time for menial tasks</h1><p>When they take priority, menial tasks will move
    you away from your goals. But you also need time away from doing "big" work. <a
    title="Are Menial Tasks the Secret to Great Achievement?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/are-menial-tasks-the-secret-to-great-achievement/"
    target="_blank">Menial tasks</a> provide a mental break that can allow you to
    reflect on your big plans. That''s why you sometimes get your best ideas while
    vacuuming or doing the dishes. It''s like a brainstorming session that can point
    you toward your next action steps, especially when you have reached a creative
    block.</p><h1>Set aside time for leisure</h1><p>Sometimes it can seem that taking
    time off for yourself means you''re betraying your goals. You should be working,
    not playing. But working too much can drain all your energy and creativity. <a
    title="The Thin Line Between Leisure and Procrastination" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-thin-line-between-leisure-and-procrastination/"
    target="_blank">Leisure</a> is closely connected to the creative process (the
    word recreation, a synonym for leisure, basically means returning to a previous
    state of ''creation''). Taking time for leisure allows you to generate a positive
    flow of creative energy, and taking this back to your work will help you to pursue
    your goals more passionately.</p><h1>Don''t reward yourself too soon</h1><p>The
    Zeigarnik effect we talked about in the first point is actually <a title="Reward
    expectancy undermines the Zeigarnik effect" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00745.x/abstract;jsessionid=4F72DA5E5894EA2AA43D50029F32203C.f02t02"
    target="_blank">undermined by reward expectancy</a>. In other words, if you expect
    to be rewarded at a certain point in time, you will be less likely to return to
    an unfinished task. And when you do return to the unfinished task, you are more
    likely to spend less time on it. You can turn this to your advantage by allowing
    yourself a reward only when you have actually completed a task, versus after a
    certain period of time. Don''t set up a reward system where you get something
    for every hour of work. Instead, reward yourself after you have checked off a
    specific task as completed. Each completed task will carry you one step closer
    to your goal.</p><p><em>Do you have any goal hacks that you''d like to add to
