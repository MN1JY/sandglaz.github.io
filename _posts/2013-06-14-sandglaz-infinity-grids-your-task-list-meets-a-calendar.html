<p>We launched Sandglaz Infinity Grids in Nov 2011 as a way to combine task lists and calendars.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Infinity Grid Milestones" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>Infinity Grids are great for busy professionals and teams that plan their work in daily or weekly chunks of time.</p>
<p>Tasks that you planned on completing today but didn't get a chance to finish will automatically roll over to tomorrow's task list.</p>
<p>We've come a long way since since the <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/blog_posts/26-Sandglaz-Infinity-Now-in-public-beta">first public release</a> of Sandglaz Infinity.<br />
And there's a lot more improvements and new features coming soon.</p>
<p>But for now, we want to breakdown Infinity Grids in detail and show you how you can combine your task list with a calendar.</p>
<h3>Time Based Milestones</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Setting Milestones" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>The most important part of an Infinity Grid are the <strong>time-based milestone</strong> for each column.</p>
<p>Each column represents a basic unit of time for the project you're working on.</p>
<p>For a <strong>personal</strong> daily task management list, set your milestone to be 1-day long.<br />
For <strong>team based</strong> projects, you might be better off using the 1-week default length.</p>
<p>Each milestone holds the tasks you plan on working on during that period of time.</p>
<p>Once you've set your milestone length, start plugging in your tasks you plan on working on in this milestone.</p>
<h3>Flexibility in Milestones Dates</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Extend or Shorten Milestones" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>Eventhough the default milestone length is 1-week, Sandglaz is very flexible by allowing you to shorten or extend milestones.</p>
<p>This is useful when you've got projects that 'slow down' and aren't as demanding (<em>extend the milestone</em>).<br />
Or if you're working on a tight deadline, you might shorten your milestones all the way down to 'daily' so you can plan all the tasks leading up to a big launch, release, or delivery.</p>
<h3>Uncompleted Tasks Move Into The Next Milestone</h3>
<p>What makes Infinity Grids different than a calendar is that if a task is uncompleted by the end of a milestone, the uncompleted task automatically rolls over to the next milestone.</p>
<p>You'll never have to move an uncompleted task forward.</p>
<p>The rolling over of tasks is what makes Infinity Grids different (and better) than <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/blog_posts/86-Stop-Using-Your-Calendar-As-a-Task-Manager">Calendars for task management</a>.</p>
<h3>Completed Tasks Stay Behind</h3>
<p>Once a task is checked off as 'completed', it stays in the milestone it was completed in.</p>
<p>So you're able to scroll back and look at previously completed tasks and see when they were completed.<br />
All of this is automatic - <strong>you don't ever have to keep a log of what you've done.</strong></p>
<p>If you need to review tasks and accomplishments with your team, they're all in there inside your Infinity Grid.</p>
<h3>The Later Column</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Infinity Grid - Later Column" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>The far right column shows you all your tasks in future milestones and tasks.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the GTD world of 'someday/maybe', think of your 'Later' column as your backlog of tasks that aren't urgent.<br />
<strong>Remember, if a task is urgent then put it in the appropriate milestone.</strong></p>
<p>When you decide to work on a task from your 'Later' column, just drag it over into the current milestone.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised if a Later column has a lot more tasks than your current milestone.<br />
It just means that you'll be busy with that project over the next few milestones.</p>
<h3>Moving Tasks to Different Milestones</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Moving Tasks to Later Milestones" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>There are a couple of ways to move a task into any milestone:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag a task into any future milestone.</li>
<li>Set the task detail's move-to date.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A task's move-to date is different than the due date.</strong></p>
<p>The move-to is like a start date for the task.<br />
It's the date you plan on starting work on it and the milestone where you want it to show up in.</p>
<p>If you need to start working on next year's budget in October, then you can set a task with a 'move to' date for Oct 1.<br />
Once the Oct 1 milestone date comes around, the task will move to your current milestone.</p>
<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a grid for each project you're working on.</li>
<li>Set the appropriate milestone (<em>weekly, daily, 10 days, etc</em>)</li>
<li>Start adding tasks to your grid and put them in the appropriate milestone</li>
</ol>
<p>** We'd love to get your feedback on Infinity Grids. How are you using them? **</p>
