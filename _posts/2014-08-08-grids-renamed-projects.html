<p>You might have already noticed that instead of the word “grids” in Sandglaz you are now seeing “projects.” We have recently made this subtle switch in the Sandglaz lingo.</p>
<p>Here's why: Sandglaz was initially inspired by the <a title="How to improve your time management skills with the urgent-important matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/" target="_blank">Eisenhower grid</a>. In that context, it made sense to call each workspace a <em>grid</em> where users can manage their tasks.</p>
<p>But as we introduced Infinity Grids, we've made Sandglaz into a more flexible task manager that allows teams to work on immediate tasks, while also planning and working on the long-term vision. The Infinity Grid - and Sandglaz as you know it now - is a combination between the <a title="Supercharge your productivity: how Sandglaz combines the Kanban board and the Eisenhower Matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sandglaz-kanban-eisenhower-matrix/" target="_blank">Eisenhower grid and Kanban board</a>.</p>
<p>We kept on calling the workspaces <em>grids</em> because it had entered the Sandglaz vocabulary. From talking to our users, we realized that this wording caused confusion for Sandglaz users. It wasn't entirely clear to many that the grids are in fact workspaces that can be shared with others. Sandglaz is designed to be a simple and flexible task management collaboration tool. If one word can make life easier for our users, we'll make sure to use that word!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2060" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/intro-6-new.png" alt="Sandglaz Project" width="179" height="248" /></p>
<p>So for simplicity's sake, we have renamed <em>grids</em> to <em>projects</em>.</p>
<p>We hope that you, our amazingly supportive (and some of you veteran) users, will adjust to this change soon. But don’t worry, if from time to time you use the word <em>grid</em>, we’ll still know what you mean! ;)</p>
