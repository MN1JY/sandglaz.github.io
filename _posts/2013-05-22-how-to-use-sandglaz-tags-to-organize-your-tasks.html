<p><img alt="Sandglaz Tags - Hashtags and Usertags" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" />One of the most powerful features of Sandglaz is the ability to tag your tasks to give them more meaning and context.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways to tag your tasks in Sandglaz:</p>
<p><b>Hashtags</b> are used to label your tasks. Hashtags always start with a '#' character. <i>Example: #Design</i></p>
<p><b>Usertags</b> are used assign a task to someone (including yourself). Usertags always start with a '@' character. <i>Example: @John</i></p>
<h3>More About Hashtags</h3>
<p>Add hashtags to your tasks to label them with information that's important to you.<br />
Tasks can have multiple hashtags and can be placed anywhere in the task field.</p>
<p>Hashtags can be customized to your working style and projects and group similar tasks</p>
<p>Here are some popular ways Sandglaz hashtag systems from users:</p>
<ul>
<li>GTD Contexts: #Home, #Office, #Errands, #Computer, #WaitingFor</li>
<li>Department or Team Function: #Design, #Copywriting, #Programming, #Marketing, #Accounting, #PR</li>
<li>Priority: #Urgent, #High, #Low, #Later</li>
<li>Job or Contract Number: #Floorplan311, #Layout948a, #FileB4</li>
<li>Client or Account: #Smith, #JohnElway</li>
</ul>
<p>Experiment with a hashtag system that works for you and your team's tasks.<br />
Try combining multiple hashtags on the same task.</p>
<h3>More About Usertags</h3>
<p>Usertags are used to assign to tasks to someone (including yourself).</p>
<p><img alt="Sandglaz Usertags" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" />Sandglaz automatically shows you all the usertags available based on who else the project grid is shared with.</p>
<p><b>One important feature of usertags are email notifications.</b> When you add a usertag on a task, the tagged user gets an email notification that they've been assigned a task.</p>
<p>Tagged users are kept up-to-date on the task's status whenever it's updated or completed.</p>
<p>If you tag yourself on a task you assign to someone else, you no longer have to check in with a coworker and ask if they've finished a task.<br />
Instead, you'll get an email notification as soon as they check it off!</p>
<h3>Filtering With Tags</h3>
<p>Once you've tried adding hashtags and usertags to your tasks, you can try filtering tasks.<br />
<b>Tag filtering is especially useful on grids with a large number of tasks.</b></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Active Hashtag Filter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>Team users can filter by usertag to see what outstanding tasks that you need to work on and what tasks have been assigned to your teammates.</p>
<p>Tag filtering is also available on the mobile version of Sandglaz from any smartphone or tablet.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Mobile Sandglaz Tag Filter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>So it's easy to get clarity on what you should be working on by filtering only tasks that are assigned to you.<br />
You can also check in with your team see what they're working on by filtering on their usertags.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of tag filtering, try combining multiple usertags and hashtags filters for complete control over how you view your tasks.</p>
