    misunderstandings and lack of clarity in delivering messages are small issues
    that eventually culminate into significant problems and at worst, lead to the
    breakdown of working relationships. Poor communication has been linked to high
    turnover rates and slower growth. A<a href="http://www.smbnow.com/articles/Inefficeint-Communications-cost-SMBs-5000-per-Employe"
    target="_blank"><span style="color: #021eaa;"> study</span></a> conducted by SIS
    International Research showed that ineffective communication cost companies of
    100+ employees more than 500,000 every year. That’s half a million dollars lost
    on misunderstandings.</p><p>So that’s the bad news. The good news is, communication
    is a skill that can be honed like any other. You can become an effective communicator
    by identifying your weaknesses, strengthening your information delivery, and<span
    style="color: #021eaa;"><a title="How to boost your emotional intelligence and
    enhance work relationships" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/boost-emotional-intelligence-and-enhance-work-relationships/"
    target="_blank"> developing an awareness of your team members’ needs and concerns.</a></span></p><p>Here
    are the five communication skills we found most important:</p><h2><b>Delivery:</b></h2><p>People
    don’t have a very long attention span: many lose focus<a href="http://fortune.com/2013/07/10/giving-a-speech-conquer-the-five-minute-attention-span/"
    target="_blank"><span style="color: #021eaa;"> after just five minutes</span></a>
    if the subject matter doesn’t pique their interest.</p><p>This is why, when you
    have something important to communicate, you should get straight to the point
    and start your remarks with your best material. Don’t get bogged down in all the
    details from the start: command attention by emphasizing the importance of your
    message and why that should be important to your interlocutor.</p><p>Clarity in
    your spoken communication, like with written content, comes from the style of
    your delivery. Don’t talk too fast or overuse fillers such as “um,” “you know,”
    and “like.” Instead, take a pause and cultivate a calm and deliberate attitude
    when you communicate. Plan what you’re going to say in advance. Avoid nervous
    rambling that stops you from making a meaningful impact.</p><h2><b>Tackle confusion
    head-on</b></h2><p>Misunderstandings frequently occur because the parties involved
    don’t voice their concerns at the start.<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/05/09/what-do-you-mean-by-that-it-just-might-be-your-communication-skills-that-are-holding-you-back-at-work/"
    target="_blank"><span style="color: #021eaa;"> Mixed signals</span></a> are sent;
    incorrect assumptions are made; and then projects get held up because not everyone
    is on the same page.</p><p>First, let’s look at mixed signals: these often occur
    when someone has concerns or disagrees with a project but doesn’t voice their
    opinions clearly. If you find yourself in this situation, don’t just acquiesce
    and then go about your day: speak up about why you disagree and so that your team
    can start working towards a constructive solution.</p><p>The same goes for assumptions:
    if you ask your coworkers for “frequent updates” on a project, you won’t be happy
    if they only report to you every other week when you meant for them to give you
    updates several times a week. So when you give instructions of this kind, be more
    specific and say “I’d like you to update me every 3 days” instead of using vague
    terms like “frequent updates.” If you’re the one receiving the instructions, ask
    your boss for clarification from the start: what do “frequent updates” mean? </p><p>When
    everyone’s on the same page, everyone is happier. And things get done faster.</p><h2><b>Pay
    attention</b></h2><p>This may seem like an obvious one, but it’s something most
    of us need to work on. So much miscommunication occurs when people are not attentively
    listening, but only recreationally listening. For example, you may be pulling
    up a report to show your coworker on your computer, but then you get distracted
    by a new important email that just came in. While your boss keeps talking about
    the latest strategy you’re working on, you start thinking about that email and
    how you should answer it. Then a few moments later, you realize that everything
    your coworker just said went in one ear and out the other  - and you don’t remember
    a thing.</p><p>It’s easy to miss part of someone’s message if you’re distracted
    with your phone, your computer, or your thoughts when they’re talking. So<a title="4
    life hacks to help you stop multitasking" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/"
    target="_blank"><span style="color: #021eaa;"> stop multitasking</span></a>: give
    people your full and complete attention. If you’re dealing with phone calls or
    emails that are distracting you from the conversation at hand, deal with them
    first and have your conversation later. Or decide before you start your conversation
    that all your other pressing tasks can wait. Just<a title="The power of single
    task focus and how to achieve it" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/power-of-single-task-focus/"
    target="_blank"><span style="color: #021eaa;"> don’t do two things at the same
    time</span></a>; you’ll end up missing something important.</p><p>Likewise, if
    the person you’re talking to appears unfocused and distracted, there are a few
    things you can do to bring their attention back to you. You don’t need to reprimand
    them harshly or show annoyance. Instead, you can deal with the problem in a positive
    way. For example, if they’re checking their digital devices you can go silent
    until they stop using it - they’ll quickly understand that they should put their
    phone away. Or, say something that doesn’t come off as criticism, but as concern.
    You can ask them if they’re having a particularly busy day, or if they’re dealing
    with an urgent issue and need a few minutes to handle it before getting back to
    your conversation.</p><h2><b>Active engagement:</b></h2><p>Learning how to be
    a great listener is as important as learning to deliver a great message. If you
    show genuine interest in what your coworkers are saying, you will probably absorb
    much more of what they’re communicating, and you’ll seem more approachable. It’s
    important to be curious, to be actively engaged.</p><p>Part of being actively
    engaged means learning more about the person you’re in communication with: if
    you open up a conversation with questions about their background or interests,
    you open up a more relaxed channel of communication where you share a greater
    amount of information with each other.</p><p>Another easy way to facilitate communication
    is simply through your body language. Don’t hunch over or turn away from the person
    speaking; sit with your shoulders back and look at them directly. Making eye contact
    does wonders for improving communication: it shows you’re alert, interested, and
    receptive to interaction.</p><h2><b>The Conviction Principle:</b></h2><p>The last
    communication skill on our list is what<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2014/04/09/new-book-lays-out-effective-communication-skills/"
    target="_blank"><span style="color: #021eaa;"> Bill McGowan</span></a> calls the
    Conviction Principle. The Conviction Principle is especially important for those
    who are a little unsure, nervous, or shy when communicating with bosses, coworkers
    or clients. In many situations, people tend to downplay their ideas and their
    talents, often to their own detriment.</p><p>So stop downplaying yourself. Convince
    your audience, and convince yourself that the idea you have is a good one and
    worth listening to. Don’t start your conversation by saying “this is probably
    a dumb idea, but...” or “I’m sure someone else will come up with something better,
    but...” If you’ve thought carefully about what you want to say and feel like you’ve
    had an idea worth sharing, you need to share it in a way that’s convincing and
    engaging. </p><p>Appearing confident does wonders not only for your own work,
    but for those around you. Ideas that are delivered in a confident way will stick
    in the mind of your audience, are more likely to be acted upon, and can eventually
    lead to significant change. So embrace the Conviction Principle and start communicating
    with confidence.</p><p><b><i>What communication skills do you find most important?
