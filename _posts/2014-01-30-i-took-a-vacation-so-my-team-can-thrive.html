    away from taking a yearly vacation.</p><h2>How to take a vacation</h2><p>A real
    vacation is one that is at least 10 days long. You want to physically leave long

    you don''t want the travel time to take up most of your vacation.</p><p>Keep your
    connection with your team at a minimal. Leave your laptop behind. Check your emails
    no more than once a day. This is for emergencies only. Resist replying to any

    the first to try to resolve it before contacting you. Before you leave, communicate
    with your team how available (or not) you will be while you’re away.</p><h2>Taking
    time off is good for your team</h2><p>When a team leader takes a vacation, it
    gives everyone else the opportunity to navigate day-to-day duties and challenges
    with full responsibility. This makes your team more independent and stronger.
    It also helps your team members find better ways to communicate better with one
    another.</p><h2>Use your vacation as a sanity check of your company’s workflow</h2><p>Do

    before you leave to make sure nothing will go off the rails and communicate with
    your teams how you want things to be handled in your absence. If there are multiple
    possibilities of what may come up, explain to your team how you want things handled
    under the different scenarios. For example, if you know they are going to hear
    back from a customer while you are away, but you are not certain what the customer
    is going to do, talk to them about the different scenarios that may come up, and
    how you would want each handled.</p><p>Use this preparation as an opportunity
    for you to assess your company’s workflow. Can you optimize how your company runs
    so that your team members are empowered to act on the day-to-day challenges of
    your business? This might give you ideas that will improve how you run your company
    on the long term.</p><h2>Could things go sour?</h2><p>I suppose they could. It
