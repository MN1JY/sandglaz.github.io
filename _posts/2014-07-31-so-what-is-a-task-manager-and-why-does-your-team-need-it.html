    about how to manage your tasks or how to use a task manager to get organized.</p><p>But
    what exactly is a task manager?</p><p>The classic explanation for a task manager
    is that it’s a tool that helps you organize your tasks. It helps you <b>plan your
    day</b>, <b>set up goals</b>, and <b>prioritize</b> what’s most urgent or important.
    Basically, a task manager is a <b>to do list</b>. This <a title="Create the to-do
    list that you’ll actually get done" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/create-a-to-do-list-that-youll-get-done/"
    target="_blank">to do list</a> can come in many forms: it can be as simple as
    a paper list, it can be an online tool, it can be a personal or a shared application.</p><p>However,
    what we at Sandglaz think of when we think of a task manager is something a little
    different. It involves the classic planning element, but what it’s really designed
    to be is a flexible tool for collaboration.</p><p><b>Why paper lists suck</b></p><p>With
    a paper list like <a title="The Bullet Journal: why analog task management doesn’t
    work" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/demystifying-the-bullet-journal-why-analog-task-management-sucks/"
    target="_blank">the Bullet Journal</a>, it’s very difficult to adapt to changing
    plans. You can cross things out, draw a lot of arrows, exclamation marks, or colour
    code your list with three different highlighters. But very quickly your list gets
    messy. In a few days or even a few hours, you probably need to write up a new
    one all over again.</p><p>What’s as big a flaw is perhaps that you can’t share
    it with others.</p><p>While writing things down may help you remember a few important
    things - buy more eggs, call your mother, install the updates on your computer
    - it just doesn’t work when you want to collaborate with a team. For that, you
    need a tool where you can easily add, remove, and reorganize tasks, and where
    these tasks constantly stay updated for everyone. You need an online solution.</p><p>In
    this day and age when the majority of our work is done online, your task manager
    should be online too. Out with the paper lists, and in with a solution that’s
    easily shared with team members.</p><p><b>An online task manager, and a flexible
    one too</b></p><p>Not only should your task manager facilitate collaboration,
    it should also reflect the way you actually work. You absolutely <b>don’t</b>
    want a task manager that imposes a structure on you that makes it difficult to
    be flexible, difficult to collaborate, or difficult to change your plans.</p><p>And
    why is that?</p><p>With huge technological change occurring from the 60s onward
    during which we saw the birth of personal computers and the World Wide Web, industries
    like software, design and marketing have flourished precisely because they’ve
    adopted flexible workflows, flexible solutions, and flexible communication structures. <a
    title="Gantt charts don’t work" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/gantt-charts-dont-work/">Fixed
    hierarchies</a> have been replaced with fluid communication structures that allow
    for greater flexibility and collaboration. Small enterprises have learnt that
    giving team members the space to grow autonomously works much better than trying
    to micro-manage their work. And vertical communication has been replaced with<a
    title="Why lateral communication is good for startups" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-benefits-of-lateral-communication/">
    lateral communication.</a></p><p>If you work for a tech startup, a software company,
    or a small high-performance team, chances are that everything from your company
    culture to your internal organization embraces flexibility and collaboration.
    And because of these new values and ways of communicating, you need a task manager
    that is flexible and collaborative in nature.</p><p><b>So what features should
    you be looking for in a task manager if you want a flexible and collaborative
    solution?</b></p><p>You should be able to assign tasks to other members, and this
    should be a <b>flat, lateral process</b>. In other words, both senior and junior
    members should be able to assign tasks to each other. This lets the senior person
    assign the junior person a specific task, but also lets the junior person ask
    for feedback through the same task system. For example, my boss may first assign
    me a new blog post to write, and when I’ve completed the task, I can ask for feedback
    by simply tagging them in a new task. It’s a huge time saver and helps cut down
    on unnecessary emails.</p><p>Sandglaz lets you tag different team members using
    a @usertag.</p><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/large.png"><img
    class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1994" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/large-300x87.png"
    alt="large" width="300" height="87" /></a></p><p>Another important feature is
    that you’re kept up to date of any changing tasks with <b>notifications. </b>This
    ties into the @usertag function: when you add a @usertag on a task, the tagged
    user will get a notification saying a new task was assigned to them. They will
    also get an email notification.</p><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/notifications-open.png"><img
    class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1996" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/notifications-open-300x181.png"
    alt="notifications-open" width="300" height="181" /></a></p><p>Your task manager
    should let you easily organize projects and share them with team members. With
    Sandglaz, you can create shared grids for specific projects or areas of your work.
    You can add as many grids as you want.</p><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/grid.png"><img
    class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1992" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/grid-300x184.png"
    alt="grid" width="300" height="184" /></a></p><p>While you can separate your work
    into different grids, you should also have a <b>bird’s eye view</b> of all the
    tasks you need to do. This is what <b>My Tasks</b> is for: in My Tasks, you can
    customize your settings so that different things from different grids show up.
    Your default settings will let you see all your tagged tasks from shared grids
    and all tasks from unshared (personal grids) in this section. This way, if you
    feel like you’re forgetting something from one grid, you can quickly look at your
    entire to do list.</p><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/final-my-tasks-grid.png"><img
    class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1995" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/final-my-tasks-grid-300x163.png"
    alt="final my tasks grid" width="300" height="163" /></a></p><p>You should be
    able to communicate within a task: often, when something is assigned to you, you
    may have to communicate back and forth with your team member before getting all
    the details settled. Each task in Sandglaz has a comment section where you can
    sort these details out. This way you don’t have to resort to email.</p><p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/commenting.png"><img

And vertical communication has been replaced with<a title="Why lateral communication is good for startups" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-benefits-of-lateral-communication/"> lateral communication.</a></p>
<p>If you work for a tech startup, a software company, or a small high-performance team, chances are that everything from your company culture to your internal organization embraces flexibility and collaboration. And because of these new values and ways of communicating, you need a task manager that is flexible and collaborative in nature.</p>
<h2><b>So what features should you be looking for in a task manager if you want a flexible and collaborative solution?</b></h2>
<p>You should be able to assign tasks to other members, and this should be a <b>flat, lateral process</b>. In other words, both senior and junior members should be able to assign tasks to each other. This lets the senior person assign the junior person a specific task, but also lets the junior person ask for feedback through the same task system. For example, my boss may first assign me a new blog post to write, and when I’ve completed the task, I can ask for feedback by simply tagging them in a new task. It’s a huge time saver and helps cut down on unnecessary emails.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandglaz.com">Sandglaz</a> lets you tag different team members using a @usertag.</p>

<p>Another important feature is that you’re kept up to date of any changing tasks with <b>notifications. </b>This ties into the @usertag function: when you add a @usertag on a task, the tagged user will get a notification saying a new task was assigned to them. They will also get an email notification.</p>

<p>Your task manager should let you easily organize projects and share them with team members. With <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com">Sandglaz</a>, you can create shared grids for specific projects or areas of your work. You can add as many grids as you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/grid.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1992 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/grid-1024x628.png" alt="grid" width="640" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>While you can separate your work into different grids, you should also have a <b>bird’s eye view</b> of all the tasks you need to do. This is what <b>My Tasks</b> is for: in My Tasks, you can customize your settings so that different things from different grids show up. Your default settings will let you see all your tagged tasks from shared grids and all tasks from unshared (personal grids) in this section. This way, if you feel like you’re forgetting something from one grid, you can quickly look at your entire to do list.</p>

<p>You should be able to communicate within a task: often, when something is assigned to you, you may have to communicate back and forth with your team member before getting all the details settled. Each task in <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com">Sandglaz</a> has a comment section where you can sort these details out. This way you don’t have to resort to email.</p>
