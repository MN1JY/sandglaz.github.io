<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calendars often get abused as task managers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of a busy workday, you probably make a mental note of what you need to get done tomorrow. Taking a moment to <a title="Do these 4 things the night before to start your day fresh" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/things-to-do-the-night-before-to-start-your-day-fresh/" target="_blank">prepare for tomorrow</a> is always a good idea. But capturing to dos in your calendar might not be the best way to go.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s why: calendars are designed to hold deadline-based and time-sensitive events. Things that you can include in your calendar are appointments, errands and deadlines. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other hand, you will have at least five to seven tasks on any given day. They might be time sensitive, but chances are you will need to move your tasks around throughout the week and adjust to new events. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><!--more--></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you find yourself moving tasks on your calendar a couple of times a week, then that's probably something you need to be tracking inside a task manager.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And how about tasks that you will want to do someday, but you’re not sure when? Don't force them into an artificially created deadline on your calendar. Those go in your task management app, not in your calendar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scheduling tasks to the hour on your calendar - whether it’s a wall calendar, an agenda or a software - is not a viable way to manage your tasks. It takes away from your <a title="Is your task manager app flexible enough?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/task-manager-app-flexible-enough/" target="_blank">flexibility</a> and your <a title="Manage projects smarter by staying open to change" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/manage-projects-smarter-stay-open-to-change/" target="_blank">ability to adapt to change</a> - which is vital to you and your business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is a time and place for calendars too, so let’s breakdown what calendars are good for and what they're bad for.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">What your calendar is good for:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Events which can’t be missed and don’t usually change. Your company’s annual general meeting. Your daughter’s birthday. Wedding anniversaries. Tax filing deadlines.</li>
<li>Meetings with team members/partners/clients.</li>
<li>Booked appointments. If you miss that dentist appointment, you’ll not only be waiting a few months until the next one, but you’ll probably be charged a ‘no show’ fee as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">What your calendar is bad for:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tying tasks to projects. Working on multiple projects means you’re probably juggling different types of tasks that related. If you’re stacking your calendar with tasks, it’s hard to see which tasks related are related to what projects.</li>
<li>Prioritizing between tasks and planning flexibly. Since your calendar makes it hard to move tasks around, it will be hard for you to prioritize among your many tasks and projects.</li>
<li>Seeing the big picture. ‘Due tomorrow’ tasks are generally not the same as <a title="How to improve your time management skills with the urgent-important matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/" target="_blank">‘most important’ </a>tasks.</li>
<li>‘Call’ reminders. Unless you’ve got a scheduled time for a meeting or phone call with someone, use a Call List to keep track of who you need to call.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to think about your calendar instead:</span></h2>
<p class="p2">Even if you've been using your calendar as a to do list, it's not too late to turn around.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280" target="_blank"><i>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</i></a>, David Allen recommends you treat your calendar only as your 'hard landscape' — meetings, appointments, and events. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The way I look at it, the calendar should be sacred territory. If you write something there, it must get done that day or not at all.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">So be discriminate about what goes on your calendar. Unless there's a date and time associated with the event, don't place it on your calendar.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your team members use a calendar software to figure out when to book a meeting with you, you can use your calendar to block off time that you need to complete your own tasks and strategic thinking and planning. This will signal to them that you’re busy during that time, without you needing to include each task on your calendar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stick to your <a title="5 things to ask when you’re choosing a task manager app" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-things-to-keep-in-mind-when-choosing-task-manager-app/" target="_blank">task management system</a> to capture your tasks and let your calendar handle your hard commitments.</span></p>
