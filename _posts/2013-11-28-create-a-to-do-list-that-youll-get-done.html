    target="_blank">bad at planning</a>, but the right to-do list can bring clarity
    to what we need to get done, how to do it and keep us on our intended path. And
    for those of us who <a title="5 Types of Procrastinators" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-types-of-procrastinators/"
    target="_blank">procrastinate</a>, to-do lists can be exactly what we need to
    get to action.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The to-do list above belonged
    to Johnny Cash and it''s a classic example of <strong>how not to write a to-do
    list</strong>. Instead, here are some simple tips and tricks on writing the perfect
    to-do list that keeps you getting things done. </span></p><h3>Use verbs, not nouns</h3><p>If
    you think about it, the name "to-do" is itself a verb. So a to-do list should
    be made up of actionable items. That''s why you should be starting them out with
    a verb. Instead of writing out a task that says ''bills'', have a task that says
    ''pay the internet bill''. Using a verb will make it easier to take that action
    when the time comes. Writing the verb as a noun can make you forget what you actually
    have to do about that task.</p><h3>Don''t include the obvious</h3><p>We''re sometimes
    tempted to put every little thing we might do in a day on our to-do list, making
    us more likely to cross many, many items off the list. Really, you should only
    be putting down tasks that you wouldn''t otherwise get around to, unless they''re
    written down. Doing the laundry might be one of them, pee isn''t. This is because
    <a title="Check Email, Do Laundry, Learn Spanish" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/check-email-do-laundry-learn-spanish/"
    target="_blank">when you''re faced</a> with two tasks that are given the same
    importance, your brain will always choose the simpler one. And if we''d put on
    our lists items like ''check email'', ''eat'', ''have coffee'', etc. it would
    certainly look like we''re getting a lot of stuff done, when in fact we''re regally
    procrastinating.</p><h3>Plan to do 5-7 tasks daily<span style="line-height: 1.714285714;
    font-size: 1rem;"> </span></h3><p>Break down your projects into bite-sized tasks,
    then make your goal to complete between 5 and 7 of those tasks daily. By not overwhelming
    yourself, you make it more likely to actually complete the items on the list.
    If you finish all those tasks, you can always get started on next day''s.</p><h3>Focus
    on one task at a time</h3><p><a title="The cognitive costs of multitasking" href="http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/costs-of-multitasking.htm"
    target="_blank">Multitasking is taxing</a> on our brains, because there is really
    no such thing as multitasking - it''s simply our brain quickly switching between
    tasks. Multitasking can actually decrease productivity by 40%! An excellent tool
    for staying focused on one task is the <a title="Can tomatoes make you more productive?"
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/can-tomatoes-make-you-more-productive/" target="_blank">Pomodoro
    technique</a>, according to which you do 25 minutes of focused work, followed
    by a 5 minute break. Of course, some tasks require more concentration than just
    25 minutes at a time, so make sure to customize it to your needs.</p><h3>Prioritize</h3><p>Decide
    when you are writing your list what are the most important items for the day -
    the tasks that you absolutely must get done. Start your day with these tasks to
    make sure that you get the big stuff out of the way. Methods like Kanban, <a title="The
    Urgent Important Matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/"
    target="_blank">the Eisenhower Matrix</a> or a combination of <a title="Supercharge
    your productivity: how Sandglaz combines the Kanban board and the Eisenhower Matrix"
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sandglaz-kanban-eisenhower-matrix/" target="_blank">both</a>
    can help you better prioritize.</p><h3>Check in throughout the day</h3><p>Make
    sure you''re staying on track throughout the day by checking in regularly. It''s
    easy to get derailed throughout the day because so much happens. Have a positive
    bias toward the items on your list - they get your attention first. Just because
    something comes up, it doesn''t mean that it''s more important than what you''ve
    already set out to do today.</p><h3>Be flexible</h3><p><span style="font-size:
    1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Sometimes deviations from the list are ok. It''s
    important to stay flexible and respond to change as it happens around you. Things
    come up that we need to attend to right away, especially when it comes to things
    that are out of our control, like a customer request. But don''t confuse being
    flexible with getting distracted from your to-do! </span></p><h3><span style="font-size:
    1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"><span style="font-size: 1.142857143rem; line-height:
    1.846153846;">Keep a record of completed tasks</span></span></h3><p>It''s good
    to revel in how much you did today, or keep yourself honest about how little you
    got done. Either way, it''s a good idea to keep a record of what you did. It can
    help you improve your practices and become more efficient, or simply allow you
    to be proud of all that you''ve accomplished.</p><h3>Find your sweet spot</h3><p>As
    with every piece of advice, it''s up to you to make it work for your needs. This
    requires a lot of introspection and experimenting with different methods to find
    out what really works for you. But when yo do find out what works for you, I can
    assure you that your productivity will just go through the roof!</p><p><em>What

<p><a title="The cognitive costs of multitasking" href="http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/costs-of-multitasking.htm" target="_blank">Multitasking is taxing</a> on our brains, because there is really no such thing as multitasking - it's simply our brain quickly switching between tasks. Multitasking can actually decrease productivity by 40%! An excellent tool for <a title="The science behind concentration and improved focus" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-concentration/" target="_blank">staying focused</a> on one task is the <a title="Can tomatoes make you more productive?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/can-tomatoes-make-you-more-productive/" target="_blank">Pomodoro technique</a>, according to which you do 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5 minute break. Of course, some tasks require more concentration than just 25 minutes at a time, so make sure to customize it to your needs.</p>
<h3>Prioritize</h3>
<p>Decide when you are writing your list what are the most important items for the day - the tasks that you absolutely must get done. Start your day with these tasks to make sure that you get the big stuff out of the way. Methods like Kanban, <a title="The Urgent Important Matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/" target="_blank">the Eisenhower Matrix</a> or a combination of <a title="Supercharge your productivity: how Sandglaz combines the Kanban board and the Eisenhower Matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sandglaz-kanban-eisenhower-matrix/" target="_blank">both</a> can help you better prioritize.</p>
<h3>Check in throughout the day</h3>
<p>Make sure you're staying on track throughout the day by checking in regularly. It's easy to get derailed throughout the day because so much happens. Have a positive bias toward the items on your list - they get your attention first. Just because something comes up, it doesn't mean that it's more important than what you've already set out to do today.</p>
<h3>Be flexible</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Sometimes deviations from the list are ok. It's important to stay flexible and respond to change as it happens around you. Things come up that we need to attend to right away, especially when it comes to things that are out of our control, like a customer request. But don't confuse being flexible with getting distracted from your to-do! </span></p>
<h3>Keep a record of completed tasks</h3>
<p>It's good to revel in how much you did today, or keep yourself honest about how little you got done. Either way, it's a good idea to keep a record of what you did. It can help you improve your practices and become more efficient, or simply allow you to be proud of all that you've accomplished.</p>
<h3>Find your sweet spot</h3>
<p>As with every piece of advice, it's up to you to make it work for your needs. This requires a lot of introspection and experimenting with different methods to find out what really works for you. But when yo do find out what works for you, I can assure you that your productivity will just go through the roof!</p>
