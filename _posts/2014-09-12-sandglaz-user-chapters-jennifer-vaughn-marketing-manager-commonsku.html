<p><b><br />
Current gig:</b> Marketing Manager for <a href="http://www.commonsku.com/" target="_blank">commonsku</a>, a software company for the promotional products industry (those are the nice people that sell you pens and shirts with your logo on it).</p>
<p><b>Working from:</b> Toronto, Ontario - usually at the office, sometimes at home.</p>
<p><b>Working on:</b> Dell PC at the office, Dell laptop at home, Nexus 5 in-between.</p>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2140" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/imgres.jpg" alt="imgres" width="209" height="241" />1. Tell us about yourself and the kind of work you do.</b></p>
<p>I’m a marketing generalist, so I do a bit of everything: copywriting, blogging, tradeshows, SEO, HTML &amp; CSS, analytics, project management, community engagement, social media, folding t-shirts, and occasionally opening the beer on Friday afternoons.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><b>2. What does a typical work day look like?</b></p>
<p>My workday usually starts at home on the couch.  I check email and do social media scheduling while I’m still in my PJ’s enjoying my morning cup of coffee.  After I get into the office, it’s a mix of meetings and computer work - though the first thing I do when I sit down at my desk is check Sandglaz.</p>
<p><b>3. How big is your team of coworkers/collaborators?</b></p>
<p>My company currently has 10 full time staff - I’m the only one in my department though.  I do the most collaboration with our UI/UX specialist, but I work with everyone in the company in the course of my job.</p>
<p><b>4. Why did you choose Sandglaz?</b></p>
<p>I’m an admitted task management hopper.  I’ve tried the lot of them. I remember reading about Sandglaz in Lifehacker a few years ago; I tried it out and stayed with it.  What keeps me with Sandglaz is the beautiful simplicity and flexibility of the application. I can expand or contract it as I need to by breaking out or condensing tasks and milestones. I also love the slick UI and how it really forces me to prioritize.</p>
<p><b>5. How does it fit into your workflow?</b></p>
<p>Sandglaz is the first place I look every morning, and about a bajillion times throughout the day. I use it to keep track of everything that I currently have on the go.</p>
<p><b>6. How do you organize your tasks in Sandglaz? </b></p>
<p>Right now I have six Sandglaz projects that represent the bigger areas of my work like blogging or landing page updates - these are areas that are never without a to-do.  I also have a catch-all project for the in-betweeners that aren’t big enough to have their own project, but are still important.</p>
<p>My Tasks is an excellent tool for organizing my day.  I use it as a reality check for scheduling out my tasks for each day.  I know that if there are more than 5-7 things on there, I won’t get them all done in a day so I update my projects to something more realistic.  Doing this helps me create timelines not only for me, but for my bosses as well.</p>
<p>I also like to make sure I note the little things that pop-up throughout the day in My Tasks.  In the past, I never really noted those things, so I would sometimes feel like I didn’t accomplish anything at the end of the day.  Now, I pop those impromptu items into my tasks as I do them, so I can review my day before I go home and have a more accurate picture of what I accomplished - even if it wasn’t to my original game plan.</p>
<p><b>7. In one sentence how did Sandglaz change the way you work?</b></p>
<p>Sandglaz helped focus me which made me more productive on the things that matter most.</p>
<p><b>8. What’s the best task or project management advice that you’ve received?</b></p>
<p>Work is about action, not about planning. Get started and update as you go along.</p>
