<p>Last month, while on a conference at <a title="TechStars Chicago" href="http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/chicago/" target="_blank">TechStars Chicago</a>, Sandglaz co-founders Nada and Zaid stumbled upon <a title="The Happy Show on Tumblr" href="http://thehappyshow.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The Happy Show</a> at the Chicago Cultural Center. The artist, Stefan Sagmeister, spent over 1o years exploring happiness and even gave a TED Talk back in 2007 on <a title="Happines by Design TED Talk" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/stefan_sagmeister_shares_happy_design.html" target="_blank">Happiness by Design</a>. It seems the Happy Show was just a natural evolution in Sagmeister's work.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_1219.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1219.jpg" alt="the happy show" width="1814" height="1355" /></a></p>
<p>At the intersection of art and graphic design, The Happy Show explores different facets of happiness - from marital satisfaction to job satisfaction. Although Sagmeister has spent a considerable time exploring happiness, the artist is reluctant to give a definition of its meaning:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am often bored with definitions, in this case though it is such an all encompassing term, that I do think it is helpful to distinguish three different levels of happiness according to time: There is short term happiness like bliss, joy and ecstasy, medium term happiness like satisfaction and well-being and long term happiness like "finding what you are put on this earth for."</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_20130919_124900.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-363" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_20130919_124900.jpg" alt="IMG_20130919_124900" width="1361" height="1814" /></a></p>
<p>Since a great chunk of The Happy Show is concerned with work, we wanted to talk more to Stefan Sagmeister about his findings and experience. In spite of his super-busy schedule, he was kind enough to answer a few questions for Team Hacks. Here's what he had to tell us about work and happiness.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_20130919_124244.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_20130919_124244.jpg" alt="IMG_20130919_124244" width="1814" height="1361" /></a></p>
<p>TEAM HACKS: Which one of the three categories - long-term, medium-term, short-term - does work fall into?</p>
<p>STEFAN SAGMEISTER: All three are possible: I can enjoy a short-term moment of bliss at work, can spend an afternoon in a state of satisfaction by losing myself in a challenging project and I can find long-term what I am good for in life within my profession.</p>
<p>TEAM HACKS: Through your studies, what conclusion have you reached about the relationship between happiness and work?</p>
<p>STEFAN SAGMEISTER: I have reached few conclusions about the relationship between happiness and work but have, by myself and with others, received a high degree of satisfaction out of my work.</p>
<p>TEAM HACKS: How is creativity related to happiness, and can "un-creative" professions derive happiness from work?</p>
<p>STEFAN SAGMEISTER: I do not think that creative people are necessarily happier than non-creative people. I do think it is satisfying when the work we do is able to help or delight other people.</p>
