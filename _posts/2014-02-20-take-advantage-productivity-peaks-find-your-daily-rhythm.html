    of your productive moments.</p><p>Of course, getting to know yourself and when
    your productivity peaks is easier said than done. For many of us, the responsibilities
    of life can be so constricting that we can’t afford to experiment with different
    styles of working. Many are caught in a 9-5 routine that doesn’t allow much room
    for creativity and time for self-improvement.</p><p>So how can you find your daily
    rhythm and take advantage of your peaks in productivity?</p><h2><b>Work in time
    increments </b></h2><p>Research has showed that intense work for 90 minute increments
    followed by a short break can really boost your the productivity and quality of
    your work. That’s how cream of the crop young violinists <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1993-40718-001"
    target="_blank">were found</a> to practice, and there’s a reason behind it: ultradian
    rhythms.</p><p>Ultradian rhythms are recurring periods that are repeated throughout
    the 24-hour circadian cycle. Basically, they are cycles within our body that are
    longer than an hour but shorter than a day, and include blood circulation, heart
    rate, thermoregulation, appetite, etc.</p><p>Research by Peretz Lavie shows that
    productive sessions of 90 minutes followed by 15-20 minute breaks sync more closely
    with our own energy cycles. This in turn allows us to <a title="The science behind
    concentration and improved focus" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-concentration/"
    target="_blank">focus</a> better and maintain higher energy levels throughout
    the day.</p><p>The thing is, different people will need different time increments.
    It might be that 90 minute increments are too little or too much for you. Play
    around with 75-120 minute time intervals to find out what works best for you.
    Either way, don’t try to maintain high energy levels throughout the day, but focus
    with intensity for predetermined amounts of time.</p><h2><b>Find out when you
    work best </b></h2><p>Most people have some sense of what time of the day they
    work best by the time they graduate and enter the workforce. But the thing is,
    most of the working world is not too accommodating to people who work best at
    ‘extreme’ hours, for example night owls. So you need to find ways to function
    at your best even outside of your most productive hours.</p><p>Even if your workplace
    does not have flexible working hours, you will still find yourself to work best
    at a specific time of the working day. Even more so, you’ll find you’re better
    at performing some tasks at specific hours - for example, you might write best
    in the morning, be more creative in meetings in the afternoon, and so on. The
    small, less mindful tasks, such as email, should be left for ‘down’ times.</p><h2><b>Minimize
    distractions during your work time </b></h2><p>Whenever you work best, you should
    schedule blocks of time to fully focus on the task at hand. Minimize distraction
    at all costs. It can take up to 25 minutes to return to the original task once
    you are interrupted, according to <a href="http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/23146/too-many-interruptions-work.aspx"
    target="_blank">Gloria Mark</a>, professor at the University of California, Irvine.</p><p>Minimizing
    distractions doesn’t only include turning off your phone and closing down your
    email app. It also means having an uncluttered desk and desktop.</p><p>Generally,
    whatever you can do to shut down the world around you, you should do. Find out
    what kind of music helps you get into a state of flow and listen to it during
    your focused work time. Do anything it takes to turn your attention away from
    the outside world and focus it on your task.</p><h2><b>Do not disturb time </b></h2><p>This
    sort of falls under removing distractions, but it’s worth a mention on its own.
    Removing outside distractions includes letting others know that you are deeply
    focused on a task and you shouldn’t be disturbed.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to close
    your office door, turn your IM status to ‘Do not disturb’, or plug in your earphones
    and not interact with co-workers for a few hours.</p><p>Let people know through
    different cues that you are taking a block of time to focus on your work, distraction-free.</p><h2><b>Keep
    yourself accountable</b></h2><p>It’s true that some interruptions come from the
    outside world. Others come from within. In fact, 44% of the time we interrupt
    ourselves. Learn to keep yourself accountable. Be honest with yourself about when
    you are actually being productive or when you are simply procrastinating with
    busywork.</p><p>Usually, intrinsic motivation will help us stay focused - you
    want to continue working simply because you are enjoying the work you do and want
    to do a good job. But when intrinsic motivation is lacking, you might want to
    put in place a reward system that will keep you motivated. No one and nothing
    but yourself can prevent you from checking your Twitter feed 25 times a day.</p><h2><b>Be
    mindful of how you take breaks</b></h2><p>If your <a title="50 ways to take a
    break, wherever you are" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/50-ways-to-take-break/"
    target="_blank">breaks</a> drain your energy and leave you even more unfocused
    than you were before, then it’s time to rethink how you take breaks.</p><p>Notice
    when your breaks cause you to lose energy and motivation. Is it when you end up
    chatting with your team members? Or when you eat your lunch at your desk? Perhaps
    the 5 minutes you took to check your Facebook feed turned into 15 and now you
    don’t even know what you were working on to begin with.</p><p>Experiment with
    the breaks you take, and mindfully notice the impact they have on your productivity.
    Sometimes, a quite 10 minute walk around the block is all you need to boost your
    productivity for the next few hours.</p><h2><b>Don’t even dare to multitask</b></h2><blockquote><p>“Never
    half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.” ~ Ron Swanson</p></blockquote><p>Multitasking
    is dead. <a title="The power of single task focus and how to achieve it" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/power-of-single-task-focus/"
    target="_blank">Single tasking</a> is in. By now, you’ve probably heard of the
    perils of multitasking. It causes us to be scattered and to lose the joy for the
    work we’re doing. It keeps us wired in a vicious circle of busy work. And it causes
    us to make more errors than we would by focusing on single tasks. What’s more,
    when our brain takes time to adjust between tasks, it results in a 40% increase
    in the time it takes to complete tasks. Don’t even dare to multitask.</p><h2><b>Apply
    what works for you outside of work</b></h2><p>After you find what works for you
    best, you will face the difficult task of making it a habit. Of course, building
    a habit means that you should stick with the right practices for a certain amount
    of time. Keep doing what you do at work to make you more productive in your personal
    life. Whether you’re working on a personal project or helping your kids with homework,
    keep doing what you’ve discovered makes you productive at work.</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>Have

Either way, don’t try to maintain high energy levels throughout the day, but focus with intensity for predetermined amounts of time.</p>
<h2><b>Find out when you work best </b></h2>
<p>Most people have some sense of what time of the day they work best by the time they graduate and enter the workforce. But the thing is, most of the working world is not too accommodating to people who work best at ‘extreme’ hours, for example night owls. So you need to find ways to function at your best even outside of your most productive hours.</p>
<p>Even if your workplace does not have flexible working hours, you will still find yourself to work best at a specific time of the working day. Even more so, you’ll find you’re better at performing some tasks at specific hours - for example, you might write best in the morning, be more creative in meetings in the afternoon, and so on. The small, less mindful tasks, such as email, should be left for ‘down’ times.</p>
<h2><b>Minimize distractions during your work time </b></h2>
<p>Whenever you work best, you should schedule blocks of time to fully focus on the task at hand. Minimize distraction at all costs. It can take up to 25 minutes to return to the original task once you are interrupted, according to <a href="http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/23146/too-many-interruptions-work.aspx" target="_blank">Gloria Mark</a>, professor at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
<p>Minimizing distractions doesn’t only include turning off your phone and closing down your email app. It also means having an uncluttered desk and desktop.</p>
<p>Generally, whatever you can do to shut down the world around you, you should do. Find out what kind of music helps you get into a state of flow and listen to it during your focused work time. Do anything it takes to turn your attention away from the outside world and focus it on your task.</p>
<h2><b>Do not disturb time </b></h2>
<p>This sort of falls under removing distractions, but it’s worth a mention on its own. Removing outside distractions includes letting others know that you are deeply focused on a task and you shouldn’t be disturbed.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to close your office door, turn your IM status to ‘Do not disturb’, or plug in your earphones and not interact with co-workers for a few hours.</p>
<p>Let people know through different cues that you are taking a block of time to focus on your work, distraction-free.</p>
<h2><b>Keep yourself accountable</b></h2>
<p>It’s true that some interruptions come from the outside world. Others come from within. In fact, 44% of the time we interrupt ourselves. Learn to keep yourself accountable. Be honest with yourself about when you are actually being productive or when you are simply procrastinating with busywork.</p>
<p>Usually, intrinsic motivation will help us stay focused - you want to continue working simply because you are enjoying the work you do and want to do a good job. But when intrinsic motivation is lacking, you might want to put in place a reward system that will keep you motivated. No one and nothing but yourself can prevent you from checking your Twitter feed 25 times a day.</p>
<h2><b>Be mindful of how you take breaks</b></h2>
<p>If your <a title="50 ways to take a break, wherever you are" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/50-ways-to-take-break/" target="_blank">breaks</a> drain your energy and leave you even more unfocused than you were before, then it’s time to rethink how you take breaks.</p>
<p>Notice when your breaks cause you to lose energy and motivation. Is it when you end up chatting with your team members? Or when you eat your lunch at your desk? Perhaps the 5 minutes you took to check your Facebook feed turned into 15 and now you don’t even know what you were working on to begin with.</p>
<p>Experiment with the breaks you take, and mindfully notice the impact they have on your productivity. Sometimes, a quite 10 minute walk around the block is all you need to boost your productivity for the next few hours.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t even dare to multitask</b></h2>
<blockquote><p>“Never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.” ~ Ron Swanson</p></blockquote>
<p>Multitasking is dead. <a title="The power of single task focus and how to achieve it" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/power-of-single-task-focus/" target="_blank">Single tasking</a> is in. By now, you’ve probably heard of the perils of multitasking. It causes us to be scattered and to lose the joy for the work we’re doing. It keeps us wired in a vicious circle of busy work. And it causes us to make more errors than we would by focusing on single tasks. What’s more, when our brain takes time to adjust between tasks, it results in a 40% increase in the time it takes to complete tasks. Don’t even dare to multitask.</p>
<h2><b>Apply what works for you outside of work</b></h2>
<p>After you find what works for you best, you will face the difficult task of making it a <a title="The behaviour grid: the key to making habits stick" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/behaviour-grid-making-habits-stick/" target="_blank">habit</a>. Of course, building a <a title="Hacking the habit loop – death of a bad habit" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/hacking-habit-loop/" target="_blank">habit</a> means that you should stick with the right practices for a certain amount of time. Keep doing what you do at work to make you more productive in your personal life. Whether you’re working on a personal project or helping your kids with homework, keep doing what you’ve discovered makes you productive at work.</p>
