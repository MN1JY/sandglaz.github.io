  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: A morning huddle is probably the single most effective meeting
    that you can have with your team. The key lies in the purpose of the team huddle.
    Your goal is to check in with team members about what your day will look like.
    The huddle is not to plan your week or projects - that’s what all the other meetings
    are for.

    look like. The huddle is not to plan your week or projects - that’s what all the
    other meetings are for.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">An effective
    morning huddle is chance for your team members to share information with each
    other and deliver project status checks. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So
    how can you make your morning huddles more successful? Here are a few things you
    need to consider if you want to run the most effective morning huddle.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><!--more--></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Should you stand
    during your morning huddle? </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes!
    If your team has not adopted <a href="http://lifehacker.com/keep-your-meetings-short-and-on-task-by-standing-up-1364051579 "
    target="_blank">standing up during meetings</a> yet, it’s time you give it a try.
    Generally, standing up will help keep meetings short and to the point. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">This is especially important during a morning huddle,
    as your purpose is to share the status of the projects you’re working on, not
    to solve problems or to </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Extra tip: 
    If you know some people on your team consistently get off topic and never make
    it back to the initial point, make it a rule that the person speaking should be
    holding a 10-pound medicine ball. The weight of the ball will be a reminder to
    keep the meeting short and on topic. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But
    remember, it’s not really about standing up. It’s about keeping the huddle short
    and to the point. So if sometimes your team members want to sit down - who cares,
    as long as they stay on point? Don''t get hung up on <a title="Rules that have
    no reason are just obstacles" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/rules-that-have-no-reason-are-just-obstacles/"
    target="_blank">rules that have no meaning.</a>  </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Who speaks? </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This
    one’s simple. Everybody speaks! If your company has 20 people or more, you might
    want to break it down into teams or departments, and then have each team do the
    morning huddle. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everybody must say something during
    the morning huddle. And if you think about it, it really makes sense: each person
    should have something to share about what they’re working on. Vocalizing individual
    status updates in front of the whole team will lead to greater commitment and
    task accountability from each team member. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Who
    speaks first? </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a number
    of different fun things you can do to keep things interesting as you’re deciding
    who speaks first. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">You don’t want your
    team to look around the room trying to decide who''s going to speak next. </span>Instead,
    you should keep it quick and fun.</p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pass the
    ball </b></span></h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a little (or big - it’s
    up to you!) ball in the office. Whoever has the ball from the previous day starts
    off the morning huddle. The person with the ball is the one who decides who speaks
    next by throwing the ball to that team member. Your throwing/catching skills should
    improve significantly with this method, and since nobody knows where the ball
    is going next, everyone will be on their toes! </span></p><h3 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Clockwise/counter-clockwise </b></span></h3><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">If you stand in a circle during your morning huddle, you can simply
    decide to go through the circle either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Simple
    enough, right?</span></p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Last come, first serve </b></span></h3><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Have the last team member who came in for the day
    be the first one to speak. Then the second last one, and so on. While this makes
    it pretty straight-forward to decide who speaks, you might stall a little bit
    as you try to remember who got to the office when. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Talk to each other </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The
    morning huddle is not for reporting to the team leader. It’s so that team members
    can communicate with each other, pull together and know what each is working on.</span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do you actually say? </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">What you say during your morning huddle depends on what your team needs.
    However, keep in mind that the purpose of the team huddle is to check-in with
    your team. Keep each update short and crisp. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here
    are some ideas of what to share during the huddle: </span></p><ul><li>What did
    you accomplish yesterday/last week?</li><li>Top 3 priorities for the day/week.</li><li>Review
    your company’s or your team’s top 3 metrics.</li><li>Share roadblocks that you
    need help in (but team members should help after the huddle, not during!)</li><li>Recognize
    other team member accomplishments.</li><li>Share personal project wins.</li><li>Client
    updates.</li></ul><p class="p1"><span class="s1">You shouldn’t try to communicate
    all of these things during your huddle. Start with a few of these items and ask
    your team to stick with them. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Review
    your morning huddle process regularly and see if it’s still fulfilling your team’s
    <a title="Office communication tools" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/office-communication-tools/"
    target="_blank">communication needs</a>. After a while, you might find that as
    your company and team evolve, you might have different things to communicate during
    your morning huddle.  </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why you shouldn’t
    try to solve problems during morning huddle </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Problem solving requires debate, discussion, and a thorough review
    of all options. In other words, it requires time! </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Since your morning huddle should be fairly short, you should schedule
    a separate meeting with the team members concerned. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Also, usually not all team members are involved in solving a certain
    problem. Be respectful of other team members’ time. If they’re not directly involved
    with the problem you’re trying to solve, why would you waste time during the huddle?
    Instead, prioritize information sharing instead of consensus building and problem
    solving. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the meeting takes a turn
    toward discussion, quickly interject and suggest that folks debating a topic need
    to <a title="How to schedule time for team collaboration" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-to-schedule-time-for-team-collaboration/"
    target="_blank">schedule a separate time to talk</a>. Then ask for the next person’s
    update.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long should your team huddle
    be? </span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shorter your team huddle, the
    better. Keep it under 15 minutes, but also allow each team member to touch all
    the points you’ve decided to talk about during your meeting. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">If huddles turn into 45 minute discussions, then you’ll start to get
    a lot of glazed over looks from everyone who doesn’t need to be part of the discussion.</span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1">When should you have your team huddle?</span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Generally, mornings are a good time to have your team
    huddle, since everyone will be extra-motivated to get their tasks done since they
    have made a commitment to their team members already. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">But beware of making your team huddle a way to start the day. Some
    team members might feel like “work” doesn’t actually start until after the morning
    huddle - <i>you don’t want that!</i> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If
    your team huddles go on too long, then try scheduling your huddle right before
    lunchtime (11:45am). Your team will have extra incentive to wrap things up quickly.</span></p><h2
    class="p2"><b>Same place, same time </b></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If
    your team works <a title="Is the 8-hour work day right for your team?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/8-hour-work-day-good-for-your-team/"
    target="_blank">flexible hours</a>, choose a core time when all the team members
    are present. Be consistent as much as possible - same time, same place, every
    day. Of course, circumstances will sometimes ask for adjustments - make sure to
    communicate these things to other team members in a timely manner. </span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remote teams </b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Daily team huddles are not just for teams that share the same work
    space. <a title="4 Tips For Teams Embracing A Working From Home Culture" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/4-tips-for-teams-embracing-a-working-from-home-culture/"
    target="_blank">Remote teams </a>can also benefit from them. The same general
    advice applies to remote teams. Of course, you will not be able to do some of
    the things - like throwing around a ball to decide who speaks first - but you
    will still gain from daily team updates. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The
    biggest advantage for remote teams who do daily team huddles is probably the commitment
    and task accountability that comes from sharing status updates with team members.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Building a morning huddle ritual will help make your
    team more effective by getting your team to vocalize what they’re working on to
    their colleagues.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It also gives everyone
    a chance to know what’s keeping everyone busy and should add depth beyond what
    your team task management tool is giving you.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>How
    do you run your morning huddles? Any tips to share on making them effective? Do

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An effective morning huddle is chance for your team members to share information with each other and deliver project status checks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how can you make your morning huddles more successful? Here are a few things you need to consider if you want to run the most effective morning huddle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><!--more--></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Should you stand during your morning huddle? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes! If your team has not adopted <a href="http://lifehacker.com/keep-your-meetings-short-and-on-task-by-standing-up-1364051579 " target="_blank">standing up during meetings</a> yet, it’s time you give it a try. Generally, standing up will help keep meetings short and to the point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is especially important during a morning huddle, as your purpose is to share the status of the projects you’re working on, not to solve problems or to </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Extra tip:  If you know some people on your team consistently get off topic and never make it back to the initial point, make it a rule that the person speaking should be holding a 10-pound medicine ball. The weight of the ball will be a reminder to keep the meeting short and on topic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember, it’s not really about standing up. It’s about keeping the huddle short and to the point. So if sometimes your team members want to sit down - who cares, as long as they stay on point? Don't get hung up on <a title="Rules that have no reason are just obstacles" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/rules-that-have-no-reason-are-just-obstacles/" target="_blank">rules that have no meaning.</a>  </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Who speaks? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This one’s simple. Everybody speaks! If your company has 20 people or more, you might want to break it down into teams or departments, and then have each team do the morning huddle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everybody must say something during the morning huddle. And if you think about it, it really makes sense: each person should have something to share about what they’re working on. Vocalizing individual status updates in front of the whole team will lead to greater commitment and task accountability from each team member. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Who speaks first? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a number of different fun things you can do to keep things interesting as you’re deciding who speaks first. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You don’t want your team to look around the room trying to decide who's going to speak next. </span>Instead, you should keep it quick and fun.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pass the ball </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a little (or big - it’s up to you!) ball in the office. Whoever has the ball from the previous day starts off the morning huddle. The person with the ball is the one who decides who speaks next by throwing the ball to that team member. Your throwing/catching skills should improve significantly with this method, and since nobody knows where the ball is going next, everyone will be on their toes! </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Clockwise/counter-clockwise </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you stand in a circle during your morning huddle, you can simply decide to go through the circle either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Simple enough, right?</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Last come, first serve </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have the last team member who came in for the day be the first one to speak. Then the second last one, and so on. While this makes it pretty straight-forward to decide who speaks, you might stall a little bit as you try to remember who got to the office when. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Talk to each other </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The morning huddle is not for reporting to the team leader. It’s so that team members can communicate with each other, pull together and know what each is working on.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do you actually say? </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What you say during your morning huddle depends on what your team needs. However, keep in mind that the purpose of the team huddle is to check-in with your team. Keep each update short and crisp. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some ideas of what to share during the huddle: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>What did you accomplish yesterday/last week?</li>
<li>Top 3 priorities for the day/week.</li>
<li>Review your company’s or your team’s top 3 metrics.</li>
<li>Share roadblocks that you need help in (but team members should help after the huddle, not during!)</li>
<li>Recognize other team member accomplishments.</li>
<li>Share personal project wins.</li>
<li>Client updates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You shouldn’t try to communicate all of these things during your huddle. Start with a few of these items and ask your team to stick with them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Review your morning huddle process regularly and see if it’s still fulfilling your team’s <a title="Office communication tools" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/office-communication-tools/" target="_blank">communication needs</a>. After a while, you might find that as your company and team evolve, you might have different things to communicate during your morning huddle.  </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why you shouldn’t try to solve problems during morning huddle </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Problem solving requires debate, discussion, and a thorough review of all options. In other words, it requires time! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since your morning huddle should be fairly short, you should schedule a separate meeting with the team members concerned. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also, usually not all team members are involved in solving a certain problem. Be respectful of other team members’ time. If they’re not directly involved with the problem you’re trying to solve, why would you waste time during the huddle? Instead, prioritize information sharing instead of consensus building and problem solving. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the meeting takes a turn toward discussion, quickly interject and suggest that folks debating a topic need to <a title="How to schedule time for team collaboration" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-to-schedule-time-for-team-collaboration/" target="_blank">schedule a separate time to talk</a>. Then ask for the next person’s update.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long should your team huddle be? </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shorter your team huddle, the better. Keep it under 15 minutes, but also allow each team member to touch all the points you’ve decided to talk about during your meeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If huddles turn into 45 minute discussions, then you’ll start to get a lot of glazed over looks from everyone who doesn’t need to be part of the discussion.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should you have your team huddle?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Generally, mornings are a good time to have your team huddle, since everyone will be extra-motivated to get their tasks done since they have made a commitment to their team members already. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But beware of making your team huddle a way to start the day. Some team members might feel like “work” doesn’t actually start until after the morning huddle - <i>you don’t want that!</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your team huddles go on too long, then try scheduling your huddle right before lunchtime (11:45am). Your team will have extra incentive to wrap things up quickly.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><b>Same place, same time </b></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your team works <a title="Is the 8-hour work day right for your team?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/8-hour-work-day-good-for-your-team/" target="_blank">flexible hours</a>, choose a core time when all the team members are present. Be consistent as much as possible - same time, same place, every day. Of course, circumstances will sometimes ask for adjustments - make sure to communicate these things to other team members in a timely manner. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remote teams </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daily team huddles are not just for teams that share the same work space. <a title="4 Tips For Teams Embracing A Working From Home Culture" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/4-tips-for-teams-embracing-a-working-from-home-culture/" target="_blank">Remote teams </a>can also benefit from them. The same general advice applies to remote teams. Of course, you will not be able to do some of the things - like throwing around a ball to decide who speaks first - but you will still gain from daily team updates. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest advantage for remote teams who do daily team huddles is probably the commitment and task accountability that comes from sharing status updates with team members.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building a morning huddle ritual will help make your team more effective by getting your team to vocalize what they’re working on to their colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It also gives everyone a chance to know what’s keeping everyone busy and should add depth beyond what your <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com" target="_blank">team task management tool</a> is giving you.</span></p>
