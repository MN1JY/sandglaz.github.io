    an alien race was to study us, they’d certainly conclude that we are a society
    of multitaskers. Present day technology has exacerbated our multitasking habits
    - we’re constantly wired, doing more things at once than we should. Our minds
    are scattered and our work suffers for it. Not only are we less efficient, but
    our ability to put our best work forward is diminished.</p><h2><b>The power of
    single task focus</b></h2><p>Charles Dickens wrote something in his novel <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/dickens/dombey/"
    target="_blank"><i>Dombey and Son </i></a> that I believe should be plastered
    on the walls of offices around the world:</p><blockquote><p>“He did each single
    thing as if he did nothing else.”</p></blockquote><p>Can you imagine having the
    focus and dedication to do one thing at a time, as if nothing else exists? Can
    you imagine being so into the present task that nothing else matters? Imagine
    how everything else - your coworkers’ demands, your long to-do list, your inbox,
    your phone - fades in the background as you dedicate your full attention to one
    task. Only one task. This might be the closest thing to the state of <a title="Add
    a little iktsuarpok into your work life" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/add-little-iktsuarpok-work-life/"
    target="_blank">flow</a>.</p><p>Now imagine everything that will happen to you
    as a result of single task focus. In the sentence following the quote above, Dickens
    continues by saying:  <b><i>“a pretty certain indication … that he is doing something
    which sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers.”  </i></b></p><p>Indeed, focusing
    on a single task at any given time will help you become better at anything you
    do, by pure virtue of you giving your full attention to what you are doing. One
    task at a time, you do your work with full focus and dedication. You can become
    more effective at work, but you can also draw benefits in your personal life.
    Your time alone and with family can become more meaningful. You will be less distracted
    when reading. Even your meals can become more tasty if you mindfully focus on
    each bite.</p><h2><b>The problem with multitasking  </b></h2><p>On the other hand,
    multitasking causes us to be scattered, to spread ourselves thin, and to rarely
    enjoy the things we are doing.</p><p>Although it might see counterintuitive, multitasking
    is neither the most effective, nor the most efficient way to work.</p><p>In fact,
    multitasking is almost never multitasking. For us to be able to perform two tasks
    at once, one of the tasks must be automatic (no focus or thought is necessary),
    and the two tasks must elicit different types of brain processing (for example,
    reading and listening to classical music engage different parts of the brain;
    this changes if you are listening to music with lyrics).</p><p>The majority of
    time, these conditions are not met. What we describe as multitasking is usually
    shifting focus from one task to another. But there is a lag time during which
    your brain adjusts, and it takes even longer for the brain to adjust in complex
    tasks. That’s why it can take up to 40% more time to multitask than to singletask.</p><p><a
    href=" http://www.scribd.com/doc/19081547/Cognitive-control-in-media-multitaskers"
    target="_blank">A 2009 article</a> shows a not-so-surprising result about multitaskers:
    they are more prone to errors and have decreased productivity levels. In the study,
    those who rated themselves as chronic multitasksers made more mistakes, could
    remember fewer items, and took longer to complete tasks than those who rated themselves
    as infrequent multitaskers.</p><h2><b>How to achieve single task focus</b></h2><p>Once
    we have learned to multitask, and even began to view multitasking as a sign of
    productivity, it can be hard to break the <a title="The behaviour grid: the key
    to making habits stick" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/behaviour-grid-making-habits-stick/"
    target="_blank">habit</a>. Indeed, it might even seem counter-productive in the
    beginning. But there are some things you can do to help you break the habit of
    multitasking and bring back the joy of focused work.</p><h3><b>Be firm in setting
    priorities </b></h3><p>You probably have a huge to-do list daily, but if all things
    on your list are important, then nothing is. Take time each day to make a shorter
    list of your most important tasks. These should be the tasks that have a high
    impact on your goals. Focus on just a few things that you really want to accomplish
    for the day. This can differ based on what each item involves, but you can limit
    it to 5-7 daily tasks.</p><h3><b>Clear distractions</b></h3><p>If you’re going
    to focus on only one task, then clear up everything else. Turn off your cellphone
    when you’re reading. Close all browsers when you’re taking care of email. Focusing
    on the task at hand takes practice, and clearing up distractions will help you
    hone that ability. You might even want to take a look at your environment and
    see if anything is acting as a distraction. It might be that your desk needs some
    cleaning, or that you often get distracted by coworkers because of where your
    office is located. Whatever your distractions are, get rid of them.</p><h3><b>Set
    aside focused time </b></h3><p>Deciding that you’re going to ditch multitasking
    and begin focusing your attention to only one task at any given time can be scary.
    That’s why setting a goal for how much time you’re going to spend focusing on
    a single task will be helpful - at least in the beginning. A technique such as
    <a title="Can tomatoes make you more productive?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/can-tomatoes-make-you-more-productive/"
    target="_blank">Pomodoro</a> might help you keep focused for reasonable amounts
    of time - at least in the beginning. But keep in mind that some tasks will need
    your focused attention for longer than others. Don’t let a preset amount of time
    interrupt your focused attention if you feel you can keep at the task longer.</p><h3><b>Take
    breaks </b></h3><p>You will be more productive if you give your brain some down
    time. We often end up multitasking because we’re scrambling to get as much as
    possible done. Most times this is why we lose focus of what matters. Being overtired
    and overworked is not conducive to focused work. Try to schedule regular breaks
    throughout your work day, and don’t be afraid to take <a title="I took a vacation
