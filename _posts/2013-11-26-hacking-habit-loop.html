    do - which is what we really need in order to get rid of our bad habits.</p><h1>The

    target="_blank">The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</a>.</p><p>The
    habit loop summarizes the pattern of our habits down to three steps:</p><h3>1.
    The Cue</h3><p>This is what triggers the habit by telling your brain to go into
    auto-pilot and resort to the habit. It''s what makes you go for an automatic choice.
    This can really be anything - how you feel at a certain moment, a specific time
    of the day, a specific situation - which is why introspection is so important
    when it comes to stopping bad habits.</p><h3>2. The Routine</h3><p>This is what
    you automatically do after you run into the cue. It''s basically performing an
    automated behaviour - the habit.</p><h3>3. The Reward</h3><p>This is what makes
    your brain remember the loop. The reward is tricky though, because sometimes it
    might not be as obvious as it seems. Let''s say you go out to buy a bar of chocolate
    every afternoon at 2 pm. The obvious reward would be the chocolate, but the hidden
    one would be getting away from the office.</p><p>In and of itself, the habit loop
    is not bad. It''s just that sometimes we can engage in the wrong routine to obtain
    a reward. Charles Duhigg explains it well in the video below:</p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OWEXk9LNPYI?rel=0"
    height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><h1>Hacking
    the habit loop</h1><p>Now that we know what the loop is all about, let''s see
    how we can break the cycle. This is not only key to helping us break habits, but
    it''s also the key to understanding how to pick up good habits.</p><h1>Experiment
    with the reward</h1><p>After you have identified the routine - checking email
    continuously or drinking a few too many cups of coffee  - experiment with the
    reward. This will help you become conscious of the cravings behind your behaviour.
    Take a look at the obvious reward to better understand the hidden one. Does that
    cigarette stand in for boredom? Or is the chocolate bar an excuse to get away
    from the office? As I said in the beginning, this requires quite a bit of introspection,
    but it will help you find out whether there''s a different (read: healthier, more
    positive) reward that will satisfy what you truly crave.</p><p>Try switching up
    the reward to see what it does to you. Instead of going to the store to buy that
    chocolate bar, try getting a different chocolate bar on one day, walking around
    the block another, or just hanging out in the cafeteria instead of going to the
    convenience store. Try different things to see what satisfies your craving, in
    order to understand what you''re really craving.</p><h1>Identify the cue</h1><p>What
    is the thing that really triggers your craving? Cues can belong to one of these
    categories:</p><ul><li>Emotional state</li><li>Location</li><li>Time</li><li>Other
    people</li><li>The immediately preceding activity</li></ul><p>Try to write down
    things that belong to these categories every time you notice a craving. After
    a while, you should be noticing a recurring cue. Personally, doing this I found
    out that I always crave a slice of pizza after a doctor''s appointment. Go figure!</p><h1>Implementation
    intention</h1><p>An implementation intention seems so easy, yet it''s so hard
    to do. Once again, this is because it requires buckets of mindfulness on our part.
    Implementation intention requires us to reframe how we break our habits into an
    "if-then" statement. Let''s say you want to stop having so much coffee in the
    afternoon. Your if-then statement could be "if I get a craving for coffee, then
    I will take a walk around the block and have an apple." The quick walk and the
    sugar will fulfill the need for a pick-me-up reward.</p><p>It might seem very
    simplistic, but implementation intentions really work. People do <a title="Planning
    fallacy: why people suck at planning" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/people-suck-at-planning/"
    target="_blank">suck at planning</a>, but having a clear action plan in mind makes
    it more likely to take goal-directed actions. In <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=v1LQVSI9hfMC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;dq=christmas+break+golwitzer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BxAyF3WWXH&amp;sig=-5OGcWKgGd42Fw2NnBdknPOXG-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QWUZT9O5AZKDsgK9neyuCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20break%20golwitzer&amp;f=false"
    target="_blank">an experiment</a> on implementation intentions, two groups of
    subjects were asked to write essays over Christmas break on how they spent Christmas
    Eve. The deadline was 48 hours after December 24th. Some of the subjects were
    then given a questionnaire asking them when and where during those 48 hours they
    were going to write the essay. Basically, this group was stating an implementation
    intention - "if it''s December 26th at 10 am, I will be writing the essay in the
    library."</p><p>The results of this experiment were quite surprising. Around 75%
    of the subjects who had created an implementation intention actually wrote the
    essay within the 48 hours. On the other hand, only one-third of the subjects who
    hadn''t completed the questionnaire did so. This is because creating the implementation
    intention makes it easier for us to get started on an action plan when we are
    faced with the cue. And as <a title="The Zeigarnik effect: the scientific key
    to better work" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/zeigarnik-effect-scientific-key-to-better-work/"
    target="_blank">the Zeigarnik effect</a> tells us, you just need to get started
    somewhere.</p><h1>Believe in yourself</h1><p>Finally, none of the above will work
    unless you actually believe that you can do it. Believe that you can make it happen.</p><p>Sharing
    your goal with a trusted, supportive friend can make you more accountable for
    your goal of breaking a bad habit and foster belief in yourself.</p><p>Now that
    you know how the habit loop works, you can turn it around to serve you. You can
    start using the cue-routine-reward not only to break bad habits, but also to create
    good ones.</p><p><em>What habits are you trying to get rid of/ pick up? I''d love

<p>What is the thing that really triggers your craving? Cues can belong to one of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotional state</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Other people</li>
<li>The immediately preceding activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to write down things that belong to these categories every time you notice a craving. After a while, you should be noticing a recurring cue. Personally, doing this I found out that I always crave a slice of pizza after a doctor's appointment. Go figure!</p>
<h1>Implementation intention</h1>
<p>An implementation intention seems so easy, yet it's so hard to do. Once again, this is because it requires buckets of mindfulness on our part. Implementation intention requires us to reframe how we break our habits into an "if-then" statement. Let's say you want to stop having so much coffee in the afternoon. Your if-then statement could be "if I get a craving for coffee, then I will take a walk around the block and have an apple." The quick walk and the sugar will fulfill the need for a pick-me-up reward.</p>
<p>It might seem very simplistic, but implementation intentions really work. People do <a title="Planning fallacy: why people suck at planning" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/people-suck-at-planning/" target="_blank">suck at planning</a>, but having a clear action plan in mind makes it more likely to take goal-directed actions. In <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=v1LQVSI9hfMC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;dq=christmas+break+golwitzer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BxAyF3WWXH&amp;sig=-5OGcWKgGd42Fw2NnBdknPOXG-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QWUZT9O5AZKDsgK9neyuCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20break%20golwitzer&amp;f=false" target="_blank">an experiment</a> on implementation intentions, two groups of subjects were asked to write essays over Christmas break on how they spent Christmas Eve. The deadline was 48 hours after December 24th. Some of the subjects were then given a questionnaire asking them when and where during those 48 hours they were going to write the essay. Basically, this group was stating an implementation intention - "if it's December 26th at 10 am, I will be writing the essay in the library."</p>
<p>The results of this experiment were quite surprising. Around 75% of the subjects who had created an implementation intention actually wrote the essay within the 48 hours. On the other hand, only one-third of the subjects who hadn't completed the questionnaire did so. This is because creating the implementation intention makes it easier for us to get started on an action plan when we are faced with the cue. And as <a title="The Zeigarnik effect: the scientific key to better work" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/zeigarnik-effect-scientific-key-to-better-work/" target="_blank">the Zeigarnik effect</a> tells us, you just need to get started somewhere.</p>
<h1>Believe in yourself</h1>
<p>Finally, none of the above will work unless you actually believe that you can do it. Believe that you can make it happen.</p>
<p>Sharing your goal with a trusted, supportive friend can make you more accountable for your goal of breaking a bad habit and foster belief in yourself.</p>
<p>Now that you know how the habit loop works, you can turn it around to serve you. You can start using the cue-routine-reward not only to break bad habits, but also to create good ones.</p>
