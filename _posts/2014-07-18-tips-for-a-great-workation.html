    nothing that says I can’t have fun while I’m working”.</p><p>Our advice is you
    should take a workation too. Here are our 4 tips for having a successful workation:</p><h2><b>Delegate:
    leave your team in charge</b></h2><p>After all, <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/"
    target="_blank">you can’t do everything yourself</a>. If you aren’t already sharing
    responsibility for important and time-consuming tasks with your teammates, you
    should probably start doing so now. Maintaining a balanced workload is key for
    you to be able to work effectively, creatively, and with <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/power-of-single-task-focus/"
    target="_blank">single focus</a>.</p><p>Not only that, it also provides more flexibility
    in your work. If you’ve been <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-benefits-of-lateral-communication/"
    target="_blank">collaborating</a> with a team member on a project for every step
    of the way, you’ll still have all your bases covered if one of you is away from
    the office for a week or so.</p><p><b>How to easily delegate:</b> Use a <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com/"
    target="_blank">task management tool</a> to organize your tasks and share them
    with other team members. With its <a href="http://support.sandglaz.com/knowledgebase/articles/284284-video-collaborating-in-sandglaz"
    target="_blank">grid feature</a>, Sandglaz allows you to share projects with your
    team members and thus facilitates collaboration, even when you’re working from
    another location.</p><p>Taking a workation is an opportunity for you to give more
    responsibility to your team members and give them space to grow. Doing so is a
    way of building mutual trust. In the end, your team will be more independent and
    stronger for it.</p><h2><b>Schedule yourself</b></h2><p>For you to take a workation
    and have it be worth it, you want to work efficiently for a period of the day,
    and then spend the rest of it exploring and relaxing.</p><p>So <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/eat-the-frog-first-stop-procrastinating-start-prioritizing/"
    target="_blank">eat the frog first</a>: do your work in the morning. Get up at
    the same time you would on a regular workday and spend a few solid hours <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/"
    target="_blank">focusing on your most important tasks</a>.</p><p>With your task
    manager, you can plan which <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/introducing-sandglaz-subtasks/"
    target="_blank">tasks and subtasks</a> you’ll focus on and set yourself a deadline
    for the time you want to finish. When that time comes, turn off your computer
    and simply enjoy the rest of the day.</p><p>Did you bite off more than you could
    chew and not complete your to-do list before your deadline? Sandglaz will <a href="http://support.sandglaz.com/knowledgebase/articles/284148-intro-to-sandglaz"
    target="_blank">automatically move your uncompleted tasks</a> to the next day
    for you so that you don’t have to worry about tasks getting left behind.</p><p>Clear
    boundaries are essential for you to be able to both work and relax. And indeed,
    your time relaxing is valuable to your time working; in that state when you’re
    not focused on a specific task or routine, you’re more likely to come up with
    new ideas. You all of a sudden have the time to think about the big picture.</p><p>So,
    keep a pen and a pad of paper handy in your down-time in case you get a sudden
    burst of inspiration and want to jot down your new idea.</p><h2><b>Let your coworkers
    and customers know when you’ll be available</b></h2><p>Since you probably won’t
    be reachable throughout the whole day, the key to having your working vacation
    be a success is to communicate your availability as clearly as possible, with
    both your team members and customers. Before you leave, let customers know that
    you’ll be away for a certain amount of time and that your responses might be slower.</p><p>With
    your team members, it does wonders for them to know exactly when they can get
    a hold of you, even if the time period isn’t very long. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/the-future-of-work/the-rise-of-the-workation-vacationers-pack-their-jobs-in-their-suitcase/article13531514/"
    target="_blank">Mr. Vlismas</a> always made sure people knew he’d be online “in
    the same cafe working for an hour and a half every day”. For the rest of the day,
    he’d work offline.</p><h2><b>Take a real vacation too</b></h2><p>Our last tip
    to you, office workers and workation enthusiasts alike, is to also take a real
    vacation! At some point, you need to give yourself a complete mental break. While
    combining work and vacation is a great way to enjoy the perks of both, you should
    at least once a year also go on a trip where you don’t bring your computer with
    you, you don’t need to check your email, and you don’t need to work on a deadline.</p><p>Vacations
    are good for us. They are good for our wellbeing, our mental health, and our creativity.
    They help us keep our stress levels down, and can help us avoid or recover from <a
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-of-burnout-and-how-to-prevent-it/"
    target="_blank">burnout</a>.</p><p>For a break to have a lasting positive effect,
    it’s not enough to get away for a long weekend. When Sandglaz CEO Nada Aldahleh <a

    about the importance of taking a vacation</a>, she stressed the importance of
    it being at least 10 days long.</p><p>Lastly: if this summer you find yourself
    unable to take a proper vacation <i>or</i> a workation, you can still <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/50-ways-to-take-break/"

<p>It’s summer. The sun is shining. The beach is calling. The soft, blue water of the bay is dotted with laughing tourists and playful kids.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you’re missing all of it because you’re spending eight or more hours a day inside, watching the summer go by instead of enjoying it.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>You don’t have to miss it.</p>
<p>Just because you’re too busy to take a vacation doesn’t mean you can’t take a workation. Why spend July in your office when you could spend it at a cottage on a lake, or at an exotic beach?</p>
<p>Not only will you be having way more fun, you might also become more productive. Being in a new location gives you a new sense of perspective, gets your creative juices flowing, and can decrease your stress levels.</p>
<h2><b>The two kinds of workations</b></h2>
<p>A workation is when you’re on vacation and working at the same time. This can be either very good or very bad.</p>
<p><b>The bad kind:</b> this is when you’re forced to bring work along on a planned vacation. Instead of taking your much-needed break and recharging your batteries for a week or two, you’re not really on holiday at all. Your work is keeping you from spending time with your family, and you find yourself flooded with emails and unable to put your phone and computer away.</p>

Maintaining a balanced workload is key for you to be able to work effectively, creatively, and with <a title="The power of single task focus and how to achieve it" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/power-of-single-task-focus/" target="_blank">single focus</a>.</p>
<p>Not only that, it also provides more flexibility in your work. If you’ve been <a title="Why lateral communication is good for startups" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-benefits-of-lateral-communication/" target="_blank">collaborating</a> with a team member on a project for every step of the way, you’ll still have all your bases covered if one of you is away from the office for a week or so.</p>
<p><b>How to easily delegate:</b> Use a <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com/" target="_blank">task management tool</a> to organize your tasks and share them with other team members. With its <a href="http://support.sandglaz.com/knowledgebase/articles/284284-video-collaborating-in-sandglaz" target="_blank">grid feature</a>, Sandglaz allows you to share projects with your team members and thus facilitates collaboration, even when you’re working from another location.</p>
<p>Taking a workation is an opportunity for you to give more responsibility to your team members and give them space to grow. Doing so is a way of building mutual trust. In the end, your team will be more independent and stronger for it.</p>
<h2><b>Schedule yourself</b></h2>
<p>For you to take a workation and have it be worth it, you want to work efficiently for a period of the day, and then spend the rest of it exploring and relaxing.</p>
<p>So <a title="Eat the frog first: how to stop procrastinating and start prioritizing" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/eat-the-frog-first-stop-procrastinating-start-prioritizing/" target="_blank">eat the frog first</a>: do your work in the morning. Get up at the same time you would on a regular workday and spend a few solid hours <a title="4 life hacks to help you stop multitasking" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/" target="_blank">focusing on your most important tasks</a>.</p>
<p>With your task manager, you can plan which <a title="Introducing Sandglaz subtasks" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/introducing-sandglaz-subtasks/" target="_blank">tasks and subtasks</a> you’ll focus on and set yourself a deadline for the time you want to finish. When that time comes, turn off your computer and simply enjoy the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Did you bite off more than you could chew and not complete your to-do list before your deadline? Sandglaz will <a href="http://support.sandglaz.com/knowledgebase/articles/284148-intro-to-sandglaz" target="_blank">automatically move your uncompleted tasks</a> to the next day for you so that you don’t have to worry about tasks getting left behind.</p>
<p>Clear boundaries are essential for you to be able to both work and relax. And indeed, your time relaxing is valuable to your time working; in that state when you’re not focused on a specific task or routine, you’re more likely to come up with new ideas. You all of a sudden have the time to think about the big picture.</p>
<p>So, keep a pen and a pad of paper handy in your down-time in case you get a sudden burst of inspiration and want to jot down your new idea.</p>
<h2><b>Let your coworkers and customers know when you’ll be available</b></h2>
<p>Since you probably won’t be reachable throughout the whole day, the key to having your working vacation be a success is to communicate your availability as clearly as possible, with both your team members and customers. Before you leave, let customers know that you’ll be away for a certain amount of time and that your responses might be slower.</p>
<p>With your team members, it does wonders for them to know exactly when they can get a hold of you, even if the time period isn’t very long. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/the-future-of-work/the-rise-of-the-workation-vacationers-pack-their-jobs-in-their-suitcase/article13531514/" target="_blank">Mr. Vlismas</a> always made sure people knew he’d be online “in the same cafe working for an hour and a half every day”. For the rest of the day, he’d work offline.</p>
<h2><b>Take a real vacation too</b></h2>
<p>Our last tip to you, office workers and workation enthusiasts alike, is to also take a real vacation! At some point, you need to give yourself a complete mental break. While combining work and vacation is a great way to enjoy the perks of both, you should at least once a year also go on a trip where you don’t bring your computer with you, you don’t need to check your email, and you don’t need to work on a deadline.</p>
<p>Vacations are good for us. They are good for our wellbeing, our mental health, and our creativity. They help us keep our stress levels down, and can help us avoid or recover from <a title="The science of burnout (and how to prevent it) " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-of-burnout-and-how-to-prevent-it/" target="_blank">burnout</a>.</p>
<p>For a break to have a lasting positive effect, it’s not enough to get away for a long weekend. When Sandglaz CEO Nada Aldahleh <a title="I took a vacation so my team can thrive. You can too." href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/i-took-a-vacation-so-my-team-can-thrive/" target="_blank">wrote about the importance of taking a vacation</a>, she stressed the importance of it being at least 10 days long.</p>
<p>Lastly: if this summer you find yourself unable to take a proper vacation <i>or</i> a workation, you can still <a title="50 ways to take a break, wherever you are" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/50-ways-to-take-break/" target="_blank">take a break</a>, wherever you are.</p>
