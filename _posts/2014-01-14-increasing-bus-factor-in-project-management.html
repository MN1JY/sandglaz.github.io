    term in software development projects, but each and every project manager should
    be aware of it. It has applications well beyond software development: it applies
    to any business, and it might apply to yours too!</span></p><p>I once worked a
    retail job at a recently launched mobile carrier, where I was one of only three
    employees, aside from the manager. Between the three of us, we were actually able
    to manage all the work, and more people were already being trained for the job.
    But through a series of circumstances that were out of our control, all three
    of us needed to take time off during the same week, leaving the manager with only
    two trainees who simply did not have the knowledge to do the job. Although the
    manager had a relatively high bus factor (three), unanticipated events almost
    left her without staff. Luckily, other locations were able to bail us out.</p><p>The
    bus factor refers the number of people on your team who need to be ''run over
    by a bus'' before the project is in trouble. Of course, for the employee to ''disappear''
    you don''t need a morbid bus accident: she can suddenly change jobs, switch projects,
    move away, have a health emergency or simply retire before the project, and sometimes
    your business, will be in jeopardy. One thing is sure: you don''t want your bus
    number to be one.</p><p>Yet when it comes to the <a title="Productivity and Team
    Size: Less is More" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/productivity-and-team-size-less-is-more/"
    target="_blank">ideal team size</a>, we know that less is more. If you want a
    highly efficient and motivated team, you should really keep it between 5-9 people,
    which is also the number of people in an agile development team. In most cases,
    unless you are severely understaffed, you shouldn''t be going around hiring people
    just to increase your bus number. So how can you increase the bus factor without
    adding extra people on the team?</p><p>The key is making sure certain vital information
    is not monopolized by a handful of essential team members by creating a culture
    of open information and collaboration. Easier said than done!</p><p>When trying
    to increase the bus number, it''s important to look at the current processes in
    place, as well as at the work itself. For example, if one key employee would leave
    your business tomorrow, how would you get access to the work he''s currently doing?
    Are all the vital files stored on his personal computer? Where did he file those
    documents that are essential to the project? And then there''s the work itself:
    who on your team can tie the loose ends of the lost member''s contribution to
    the project?</p><h2>Simplify your processes</h2><p>Aim to make it almost impossible
    for one employee to hold all the information by simplifying your processes. This
    includes using technologies that are easily accessible and available to everyone,
    as well as technologies that anyone can easily learn. In the day and age of SaaS,
    where everything from customer relationship management to invoicing is done ''in
    the cloud'', there''s no reason not to. You can start by filing and sharing your
    internal documents through Dropbox or Google Drive. Reviewing your [office communication
    tools](http://blog.sandglaz.com/office-communication-tools/) and practices will
    also play a big role in simplifying your processes.</p><h2>Start at the hiring
    level</h2><p>You can increase your bus number from the moment you <a title="A
    guide to hiring the right people for your startup or small business" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/a-guide-to-hiring-the-right-people-for-your-startup-or-small-business/"
    target="_blank">hire your team members</a>. When interviewing, pay close attention
    to the candidate''s ability and willingness to learn new things. Highly resourceful,
    curious people who learn on the fly can quickly step in when one of their team
    members leaves the project. An innate sense of curiosity will guarantee that this
    employee will take interest in what her team members are working on. And a strong
    foundation in their field will help them figure things out on their own in critical
    moments.</p><h2>Regular team updates</h2><p>Meetings can often be a waste of time,
    but it''s not so with team updates. Try a weekly update meeting, or even better,
    a daily [morning huddle](http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-to-run-a-morning-huddle-with-your-team/)
    where each team shares what has been accomplished and what are their top priorities
    for the next leg of the project. You should also encourage sharing possible roadblocks
    that team members can help solve after the meeting. This will definitely boost
    collaboration and the sharing of information.</p><h2>Cross-training</h2><p>It''s
    not only necessary that team members know what everyone is working on, but also
    that they know <em>how</em> everyone is working. You can have a low bus factor
    if there is no skill redundancy on your team. You want your employees to be generalists
    to some degree. Cross-training in basic tasks will ensure that the tasks can be
    covered for when one employee goes under the bus. As much as possible, you want
    every member on the team to have at least one secondary skill that will allow
    them to cover for a team member.</p><h2>Pair programming</h2><p>Again, there''s
    something to learn about collaboration from this agile development technique.
    Pair programming is a technique where two programmers sit together at one workstation.
    The driver writes the code while the navigator reviews each line as it is typed
    in. The programmers switch roles frequently. There''s also another style of pair
    programming, called <em>promiscuous pairing</em>, where each programmer works
    with all the other programmers on the team instead of pairing with only one programmer.</p><p>Of
    course, this technique is not applicable to every position you might have in your
    team. Sometimes it''s not viable to have two people work together on a sub-team.
    But it teaches us something about a culture of learning and collaboration. Programmers
    get to see and examine their partner''s work and provide feedback. This is essential
    not only for sharing information, but also for the team members to develop their
    own learning mechanisms.</p><h2>Flexibility</h2><p>You can cheat the bus factor
    by allowing workers to work out of the office. If your employee is at home with
    a stubborn cold that you don''t want to spread around the office, chances are
    they are still able to do part of the job. If their child is sick, they can still
    perform some of their responsibilities while away. This doesn''t solve the problem
    of what would happen if a team member permanently left the team, or if they are
    not capable of fulfilling their duties remotely. But it is a good way to trick
    the bus number when your other options are limited.</p><p>The key thing about
    the bus factor is that with adequate management, it''s in your hands to increase
    it. The main takeaway is to encourage an environment of learning and collaboration
    that will spread information to all team members.</p><p><em>What''s your bus factor?
