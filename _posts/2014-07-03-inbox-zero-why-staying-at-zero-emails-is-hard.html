    class="p1"><span class="s1">Inbox Zero - it’s a productivity benchmark, the Holy
    Grail of the connected lifestyle. And yet it’s so elusive for many busy professionals.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of us reach the zen state of zero emails that
    comes along with the satisfaction of knowing that all that needs your attention
    has been dealt with or filed away. But this is only for a few fleeting moments,
    and the start of the next workday surely starts with a fresh flow of emails. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how aggressively you handle your incoming
    mail, it just doesn’t seem to stick. Inbox Zero is more like Inbox 50 for most
    of us.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But is Inbox Zero really about
    having no emails in your inbox? </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not
    really. The man who coined the concept of <a href="http://www.activeinboxhq.com/support/inbox_zero_gmail.php"
    target="_blank">Inbox Zero says so himself</a>: </span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">"It''s about how to reclaim your email, your attention, and your life.
    That ''zero?'' It''s not how many messages are in your inbox - it''s how much
    of your own brain is in that inbox. Especially when you don''t want it to be.
    That''s it.” ~ Merlin Mann</span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So
    let’s get this clear: Inbox Zero is not about the actual number of emails parked
    in your inbox. It’s about the attention that you’re diverting from other tasks
    to those emails that are nagging at you. These are the kind of emails you''re
    probably dealing with on a daily basis. If you''re at a loss for how to deal with
    them, here are a few solutions. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emails
    that need action, but not until later</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A
    majority of emails that stay sitting in your inbox as tasks are probably in this
    category.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">You know what you need to do
    with the message, but it''s not urgent enough to work on it right now.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">These <a title="How to improve your time management
    skills with the urgent-important matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/"
    target="_blank">important (but not urgent)</a> messages can''t disappear from
    your view.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because, after all, they <em>are</em>
    important.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you keep them around and
    they sit silently in a sea of your other unread messages.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">You spend <a title="How to improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/"
    target="_blank">cognitive stamina</a> each time you skip them over in your inbox
    and think to yourself, <em>"Oh yeah, I was going to do this today.”</em></span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong> instead of parking those
    emails in your inbox, add the tasks in your <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/"
    target="_blank">task management tool</a>. But if an email takes less than two
    minutes to deal with, get it done right away.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Multiple
    related email threads on one project</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A
    lot of times, multiple email threads come in over the course of a week on a single
    project.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And because you kept the first
    email thread of the project in your inbox (you had planned to do something about
    it later), the additional threads also get parked there because they''ve got more
    context and the latest detail on the work.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong>
    don’t park the first email in your inbox to begin with. Add it as a task in your
    task manager, and then <a title="Introducing Sandglaz subtasks" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/introducing-sandglaz-subtasks/"
    target="_blank">add subtasks</a> for the email threads that follow. </span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Work-in-progress attachment emails</b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">If part of your work is spent handling, editing, updating,
    and delivering attachments (spreadsheets, presentations, proposals), then you''re
    probably parking versions of attachments in your inbox.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">This gets compounded when you''re working with other coworkers on the
    same document:</span></p><p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">"Who''s got the latest
    version of the presentation?"</span></em></p><p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">"Oh
    I do - I''m just adding to it and I''ll email it to you when I''m done."</span></em></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Sound familiar?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong>
    if you need to collaborate with team members on documents, use Google Docs. It
    has a very useful commenting tool and you can collaborate in real time. For file
    sharing (but not collaborating), Dropbox is a great solution. And you can make
    it easier for each other and reduce the number of emails with attachments by <a
    title="New Sandglaz feature: attach files with Dropbox" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sandglaz-feature-attach-files-dropbox/"
    target="_blank">attaching your documents to your tasks</a> in your task management
    app. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emails that need more thinking</b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Finding time to think in busy, fast paced workplace
    can be challenging.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So when you get an
    email and are unsure what to do about it, chances are that it needs more thinking
    time.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Much of what gets parked in your
    inbox requires more thinking, planning, and finally a decision on what to do about
    it. </span>The lack of an outcome on the email keeps it in your inbox until you''re
    able to find time to decide what you want to do with the message - which can often
    take a while.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong> keep
    a list of research/thinking/ideas that have potential in your task management
    app instead of keeping all those emails in your inbox. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>How to reach Inbox Zero - the state of mind, not the number </b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Merlin Mann offers five simple actions to tame your
    inbox: </span></p><ul><li>Delete</li><li>Delegate</li><li>Respond</li><li>Defer</li><li>Do</li></ul><p><iframe

    also a great tool for all those subscription emails that you still want to read,

    apps of 2014" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/must-productivity-apps-2014/" target="_blank">2014’s
    must-have productivity apps</a>. It takes all those emails that are neither important,
    nor urgent, but you still want to read, rolls them up and sends them to you in
    a daily digest delivered at the time of your choosing. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">As you manage your inbox, try to decide within a few seconds which
    of the actions above you’re going to take. If you can’t decide right away, then
    defer them. Your task management tool will be your best friend in categorizing
    and managing the actions you need to take regarding your emails. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t waste your cognitive RAM on glaring over the
    same emails that need action later. Instead, choose to deal with them in your
    own time. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>What''s your experience

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inbox Zero - it’s a productivity benchmark, the Holy Grail of the connected lifestyle. And yet it’s so elusive for many busy professionals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The term Inbox Zero was <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/13/inbox-zero" target="_blank">first coined</a> by writer, speaker and productivity expert <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/" target="_blank">Merlin Mann</a>. It’s an approach to email management in which you aim to keep your inbox empty - or as empty as you can - at all times. This is where the term "Inbox Zero" comes from. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The average corporate worker <a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Email-Statistics-Report-2011-2015-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank">receives about 105 emails a day</a> and <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy" target="_blank">more than a quarter of workers’ time</a> is spent reading and replying to emails. The need for a better way to manage our relationship with our email inbox is obvious and inevitable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what is different about Inbox Zero? According to Mann, Inbox Zero allows you to distinguish between your to-do list and your inbox, and to boost your productivity. It also allows you to manage time and attention - which are both finite resources that you want to make the most of during your work day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of us reach the zen state of zero emails that comes along with the satisfaction of knowing that all that needs your attention has been dealt with or filed away. But this is only for a few fleeting moments, and the start of the next workday surely starts with a fresh flow of emails. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how aggressively you handle your incoming mail, it just doesn’t seem to stick. Inbox Zero is more like Inbox 50 for most of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">But is Inbox Zero really about having no emails in your inbox? </span></strong></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"It's about how to reclaim your email, your attention, and your life. That 'zero?' It's not how many messages are in your inbox - it's how much of your own brain is in that inbox. Especially when you don't want it to be. That's it.” ~ Merlin Mann</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So let’s get this clear: Inbox Zero is not about the actual number of emails in your inbox. It’s about the attention that you’re diverting from other important tasks to those emails that are constantly nagging at you because you need to do something about them. These are the kind of emails you're probably dealing with on a daily basis. If you're at a loss for how to deal with them, here are a few solutions. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emails that need action, but not until later</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A majority of emails that stay sitting in your inbox as tasks are probably in this category.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You know what you need to do with the message, but it's not urgent enough to work on it right now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These <a title="How to improve your time management skills with the urgent-important matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/" target="_blank">important (but not urgent)</a> messages can't disappear from your view.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because, after all, they <em>are</em> important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you keep them around and they sit silently in a sea of your other unread messages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You spend <a title="How to improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/" target="_blank">cognitive stamina</a> each time you skip them over in your inbox and think to yourself, <em>"Oh yeah, I was going to do this today.”</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong> instead of parking those emails in your inbox, add the tasks in your <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/" target="_blank">task management tool</a>. But if an email takes less than two minutes to deal with, get it done right away.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Multiple related email threads on one project</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of times, multiple email threads come in over the course of a week on a single project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And because you kept the first email thread of the project in your inbox (you had planned to do something about it later), the additional threads also get parked there because they've got more context and the latest detail on the work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong> don’t park the first email in your inbox to begin with. Add it as a task in your task manager, and then <a title="Introducing Sandglaz subtasks" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/introducing-sandglaz-subtasks/" target="_blank">add subtasks</a> for the email threads that follow. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Work-in-progress attachment emails</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If part of your work is spent handling, editing, updating, and delivering attachments (spreadsheets, presentations, proposals), then you're probably parking versions of attachments in your inbox.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This gets compounded when you're working with other coworkers on the same document:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">"Who's got the latest version of the presentation?"</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">"Oh I do - I'm just adding to it and I'll email it to you when I'm done."</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sound familiar?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong> if you need to collaborate with team members on documents, use Google Docs. It has a very useful commenting tool and you can collaborate in real time. For file sharing (but not collaborating), Dropbox is a great solution. And you can make it easier for each other and reduce the number of emails with attachments by <a title="New Sandglaz feature: attach files with Dropbox" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sandglaz-feature-attach-files-dropbox/" target="_blank">attaching your documents to your tasks</a> in your task management app. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emails that need more thinking</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finding time to think in busy, fast paced workplace can be challenging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So when you get an email and are unsure what to do about it, chances are that it needs more thinking time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Much of what gets parked in your inbox requires more thinking, planning, and finally a decision on what to do about it. </span>The lack of an outcome on the email keeps it in your inbox until you're able to find time to decide what you want to do with the message - which can often take a while.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Solution:</strong> keep a list of research/thinking/ideas that have potential in your task management app instead of keeping all those emails in your inbox. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How to reach Inbox Zero - the state of mind, not the number </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Merlin Mann offers five simple actions to tame your inbox: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s also a great tool for all those subscription emails that you still want to read, but don’t want clogging your inbox. It’s <a href="https://unroll.me/" target="_blank">Unroll.me</a>, an app we’ve written about in our roundup of <a title="The must-have productivity apps of 2014" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/must-productivity-apps-2014/" target="_blank">2014’s must-have productivity apps</a>. It takes all those emails that are neither important, nor urgent, but you still want to read, rolls them up and sends them to you in a daily digest delivered at the time of your choosing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As you manage your inbox, try to decide within a few seconds which of the actions above you’re going to take. If you can’t decide right away, then defer them. Your task management tool will be your best friend in categorizing and managing the actions you need to take regarding your emails. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t waste your cognitive RAM on glaring over the same emails that need action later. Instead, choose to deal with them in your own time. </span></p>
