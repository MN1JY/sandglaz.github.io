    employees (the only kind you''ve hopefully <a title="A guide to hiring the right

    stimulation is the most important aspect of an employee''s job satisfaction AND
    it contributes most to their overall happiness.</p><p>So how can you motivate
    your employees through intellectual stimulation? Offer them task variety, autonomy,
    influence and the opportunity to acquire recognition. Then offer them some more
    of that.</p><h2>2. You discourage open communication</h2><p>There is nothing that
    kills motivation more than feeling your opinion doesn''t matter. There is no employee
    that will not appreciate good communication from management. It''s the key to
    a healthy work environment.</p><p>Especially in a small business setting, you
    need the full commitment and participation of your employees. An atmosphere of
    open communication can provide a highly motivated workforce where employees not
    only understand the goals of your business, but also what they need to do to accomplish
    these goals.</p><p>Keep the lines of communication open and give everyone equal
    participation in the success of your business. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714;

    great lengths to understand who your customers are - what they like, what they
    desire, what keeps them up at night.</p><p>So why not put the same effort into
    understanding your employees? Do you know what are their dreams and aspirations?
    How about where they eventually want to be professionally?</p><p>Knowing this
    will help you place them in a role that will motivate them, but it will also help
    you extract their full potential on the job.</p><h2>4. You''re unadaptable</h2><p>If
    your workforce lacks motivation, then take a close look at how flexible the management
    is. Understand that every situation is different, and might call for different
    approaches.</p><p>Of course, any business has guidelines. But rules can often
    be bent depending on the circumstances. Unless you have robots as employees, your
    team members need to feel they have the autonomy to judge the circumstances and
    implement the best outcome.</p><p>Being a flexible team manager also means that
    you allow team members to learn from their mistakes (this goes hand in hand with
    micromanagement).</p><h2>5. You don''t recognize accomplishments</h2><p>Not recognizing
    accomplishments tells your employees that you don''t care about the work they
    do. Even worse, if you communicate negative outcomes but don''t recognize accomplishments,
    you might be discouraging them from taking healthy risks.</p><p>While you should
    definitely focus on what challenges your team is facing ahead, you should also
    spend some time reflecting on how much has already been achieved. Take as an example
    the financial services company Acuity. All departments are asked to recognize
    their own work and provide a list of significant accomplishments. Then the lists
    are reviewed by Acuity officers, who select the 100 most outstanding for an annual
    list of the company''s "Top 100 Accomplishments". The company''s CEO personally
    thanks employees for their impact on the company''s bottom line. How''s that for
    an incentive?</p><p>When your team feels that accomplishments are celebrated,
    they will feel more motivated to hit your company''s milestones.</p><h2>6. You

    110% for your company.</p><p>When employees clearly understand their role and
    the impact they have on the organization, they are also able to deliver on your

<p>Before looking at ways to motivate your staff, you must look at how you demotivate them. You might not even be aware that what you do demotivates your staff. Motivation goes hand in hand with morale. Disenchanted employees skyrocket turnover rates, often leaving companies without the workers they needed to retain.</p>
<p>While most employers make the mistake of thinking that money will improve any issues related to employee motivation, you probably know by now that money usually <a href="http://wgbhnews.org/post/can-money-buy-happiness" target="_blank">doesn't buy employee happiness</a>.
