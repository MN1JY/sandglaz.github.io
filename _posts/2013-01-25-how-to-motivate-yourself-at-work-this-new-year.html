<p>Working in January can be a wholly depressing experience. Memories of Christmas and New<br />
Year are fading fast, your body’s stuck in a holiday sleeping pattern and you can’t afford to<br />
buy or do anything to cheer yourself up.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t have to be this way (honestly). Here are a few things you could try to<br />
motivate yourself to work better this new year.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Exercise (particularly at work)</h3>
<p>A lot of people will attempt to exercise more in an attempt to live healthier in 2013.<br />
However, there are further benefits to leading a more active lifestyle this year. Research<br />
from the University of Bristol found people who exercise on work days are happier and less<br />
stressed at work. Many workers also found their productivity increased if they exercised on<br />
a workday.</p>
<p>You could potentially join a gym or a sports team, but your working day offers a whole host<br />
of simple ways to get fitter. You could walk or cycle to work rather than drive, or hit the<br />
gym or go for a jog in your lunch break. Whatever you do, it could really help you motivate<br />
yourself to work better!</p>
<h3>Ask for a change of scenery</h3>
<p>If you are getting sick of the same old office routine, why not ask your boss if you can<br />
work remotely occasionally? Working from home has many advantages; senior staff who<br />
responded to a recent Ceridian survey said employees who were allowed to work from<br />
home were actually happier and more productive. So there are plenty of reasons why your<br />
boss should say yes!</p>
<p>This is becoming an option for an increasing number of companies, due to the growing<br />
ubiquity of ‘cloud’ data storage; allowing employees to access documents and data<br />
remotely when they previously would have had to come into the office. Microsoft last year<br />
employed a ‘virtual summer’ in their offices and many of their employees found it to be a<br />
refreshing change, and it could be for you too!</p>
<h3>Keep on top of your emails</h3>
<p>Few things at work can feel worse than beginning to lose control of your workload. With<br />
most respondents to a recent poll saying they get more than 100 emails every day it is very<br />
easy to fall into letting your unread messages build and build.</p>
<p>It takes many people a while to get going fully in the morning, so why not dedicate this time<br />
to sorting out your inbox? This way you may avoid becoming one of the 6% of people who<br />
have simply given up all hope of ever sorting their unread messages.</p>
<h3>Escape work when you can</h3>
<p>A good work/life balance can do wonders for your motivation, and a key step towards<br />
achieving this could be getting away from the desk during your breaks. By doing so you can<br />
build some clear boundaries between work and break time, and feel the beneficial effects of<br />
doing so!</p>
<p>A study commissioned by Ryvita found 79% of people feel more energized when they have<br />
been able to get out of the office at lunchtime. Furthermore, going for a bite to eat with<br />
your workmates can be a great way to get to know them better and develop your working<br />
relationships, which can only help motivation!</p>
