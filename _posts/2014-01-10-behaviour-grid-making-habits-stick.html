    etc. Making habits stick is hard, and we all need a little guidance. But what
    most advice pieces lose sight of is that **there are different types of habits**.
    \n\nThis is where Stanford professor [BJ Fogg](http://www.bjfogg.com/)'s [behavioural
    model](http://www.behaviormodel.org/) comes in.  Fogg and his team focus on methods
    for creating habits, causes of behaviour, and behaviour change automation.  He
    teaches Stanford students how to create tech systems that change behaviour. Ever
    heard of a little app called Instagram? It has influenced the behaviour of more
    than 150 million monthly users. And one of its co-founders, Mike Krieger, was
    Fogg's student at Stanford. \n\nSo Fogg's methodology is definitely on to something
    here: it's proven that it actually does affect behaviour. But let's see how it
    can be applied to picking up a new habit. \n\n##Identify what kind of habit you
    want to implement\n\nWhen you do decide to change a habit, you should ask yourself
    these two questions first: \n1. Am I starting a new behaviour, restarting a familiar
    behaviour or increasing an existing behaviour? \n2. Is this behaviour going to
    happen one time only (plant a tree), for a certain period of time (a month-long
    daily yoga challenge), or always from now on (floss every night before going to
    sleep)? \n\nBecause habits are by definition repetitive, they fall under starting,
    restarting or increasing a behaviour for a period of time or from now on. \n\nFogg's
    [behaviour grid](http://www.behaviorgrid.org/) maps 15 kinds of behaviour change.
    It contains three rows: dot behaviour, happening only one time; span behaviour,
    lasting for a certain duration of time;  and path behaviour, which is a permanent
    change. \n\nWe can see that when it comes to creating new habits there are six
    possibilities: green span, blue span, purple span, green path, blue path and purple
    path. \n\n[caption id=\"attachment_884\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"657\"]<img

    wp-image-884\" /> Photo courtesy of the Behaviour Wizard http://www.behaviorwizard.org/wp/[/caption]\n\n##The
    key elements\n\nAccording to Fogg, for a behaviour to happen, a combination of
    these three key elements must be present:\n\n1. **Motivation** must be present
    when the trigger occurs in order for the behaviour to be carried out. If motivation
    is high, then the person engaging in the behaviour might be willing to do so even
    when the behaviour is difficult. \n2. **Ability** implies that a person must have
    the ability to perform a certain behaviour, including knowing how to perform the
    behaviour. This sometimes implies simplifying a behaviour in order to make it
    stick. \n3. **Triggers** are the prompts that tell us to perform a certain behaviour
    in a particular instant. Triggers can range from a specific time of the day to
    a specific situation or an internal signal from our body. \n\nHowever, depending
    on where the behaviour falls on the behaviour grid, it requires each key element
    to a different degree. Each one of the behaviours involved in habit formation
    is characterized by a different balance of these three elements. \n\nLet's say
    you **want to pick up a new behaviour from now on**, for example you want to keep
    a daily gratefulness journal. For this to happen, you need to boost your motivation
    (if it's necessary - you might already be pumped up for the new behaviour) and
    enhance your ability by making it simple to commit to the action. The cue that
    tells you to write down your grateful thoughts must then happen when both your
    motivation and your ability to do the action are in optimal states. \n\nBut let's
    say that you're trying to **increase a behaviour from now on**. For example, you
    want to jog for 10 minutes more each day or save 5% more of your income from now
    on. To increase the behaviour, you also need to increase the number of triggers
    leading to that desirable behaviour and amplify the motivation through both intrinsic
    and extrinsic motivators. It will be much easier to save an extra 5% if you are
    motivated by a vacation at the end of the year (motivation). It will also be easier
    to stop spending money on unnecessary purchases by placing a picture of your destination
    in your wallet to see every time you open it (trigger). \n\n##Effective triggers:
    taking baby steps \n\nEffective triggers prompt you to do something that is both
    easy  and you're motivated to do. A trigger that initiates a difficult action
    can be frustrating, and one that nudges you to do something that you're not motivated
    to is simply annoying. \n\nWith human nature being what it is, it's often a lot
    easier to make a task easier than boost motivation. That's why many times  the
    key to habit formation is simply taking baby steps. Make it easier to do something
    that you already want to do but find it too hard or are not motivated enough.
    \n\nAs [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/habitses/) says, *\"Make it so easy
    you can't say no.\"* \n\nYou might want to start exercising regularly, but that
    habit won't solidify if you do one hour of cardio each day for a week and then
    stop. Instead, you can start by doing two minutes of cardio. Two minutes is not
    a big commitment. It's so easy you can't refuse yourself. \n\nOf course, the point
    is to build up to your goal. But in the beginning, what matters more is that your
    behaviour becomes consistent. When you have consistency, then you can build on
    top of that behaviour and give it more dimensions. \n\n\n*What habits are you
    trying to pick up? We'd love it if you shared your journey with us in the comment
    section below.*\";s:3:\"url\";s:25:\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/\";}}"

<p>There is a lot of advice out there about how to start flossing, exercising, eating healthy, etc. Making habits stick is hard, and we all need a little guidance. But what most advice pieces lose sight of is that <strong>there are different types of habits</strong>.</p>
