    mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption in the activity.</b>”</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Nobody wants to be in a state of burnout. Yet too
    many of us have found ourselves feeling exhausted and disengaged from our work.
    In fact, Gallup’s <a href="http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/164735/state-global-workplace.aspx"
    target="_blank">State of the Global Workplace</a> study suggests that a mere 13%
    of the world’s workers are actively engaged with their work. How about the remaining
    87% who are either not engaged or actively disengaged? Perhaps not all of them
    suffer from burnout, but it’s safe to say that a vast majority of them might.
    Work-related burnout is definitely a prevalent issue in the workplace that needs
    to be addressed - both by individuals and organizations. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">To find ways to prevent and solve the issue of burnout, we need to
    first understand what causes it.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What
    causes burnout</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to
    note that burnout is a recognized as a health problem in the 10th revision of
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank">International
    Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</a>. It is
    specified as a “state of vital exhaustion” under “problems related to life-management
    difficulty.” And this is the key to understanding the causes of burnout.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Although we often think of burnout in relation to
    our careers, anyone who feels overworked and under-appreciated is at risk - from
    the CEO to the stay-at-home parent.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet
    burnout isn’t only about how many responsibilities we’re juggling on a daily basis.
    Other factors that contribute to burnout are certain personality traits and your
    your lifestyle. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, high-achieving,
    Type A personalities are at a higher risk for burnout. So are those who have a
    pessimistic view of the world, and those who take on too many responsibilities
    or are reluctant to delegate to others. Poor quality of sleep is also a big cause
    of burnout, as is a lack of a support network.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When
    it comes to work, burnout is more likely to creep up on you when your work is
    either extremely predictable and monotonous, or extremely high-pressure and demanding.
    Lack of recognition is also a major cause of work-related burnout.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">In their study on the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213058614000060"
    target="_blank"><i>Relationship between burnout and depressive symptoms</i></a>,
    Kirsi Ahola and her colleagues have discovered that burnout and depressive symptoms
    develop in parallel and cluster together. That’s probably what makes burnout so
    dangerous: it doesn’t come alone. Aside from depression, it also brings with it
    physical exhaustion, lowered immunity, frequent headaches, back pain and muscle
    aches.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Indicators of burnout </b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">The physical signs and symptoms of burnout mentioned
    above can be quite obvious. It’s not so, however, when it comes to the emotional
    and behavioural signs.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emotional signs
    are subjective and can only be identified by the person that is experiencing burnout.
    These can include feelings of helplessness, dissatisfaction, a sense of failure
    and self-doubt, and loss of motivation.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">On
    the other hand, behavioural signs are much easier to spot by those around the
    person experiencing burnout. These are the signs team leaders should look for if
    they think </span>their team members are experiencing burnout: isolation, withdrawal
    from responsibilities, taking longer to get things done, and decreased work productivity.</p><p

    or want to check how advanced of a state you’re in, check out a <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm"
    target="_blank">burnout self-test</a>.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What
    to do about burnout</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with everything,
    it’s preferable to prevent burnout from appearing in the first place than to treat
    it. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prevention can involve the following
    actions: </span></p><ul><li>Setting time aside for relaxing rituals, such as reading
    something inspirational, meditating, stretching, writing in your journal, etc.</li><li>Adopting
    healthy habits that <a title="The science behind maintaining high energy levels"
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/"
    target="_blank">increase your energy levels</a>.</li><li>Learning how to <a title="How
    to handle stress more efficiently" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/handle-stress-efficiently/"
    target="_blank">handle stress more efficiently</a>.</li><li><a title="Delegate
    effectively while striving for perfection" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/"
    target="_blank">Delegating</a> and setting boundaries on the workload you take
    on.</li><li>Regularly disconnecting from your work and responsibilities. This
    includes taking regular breaks from technology.</li></ul><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet
    sometimes it’s too late to prevent burnout because we’re already past the breaking
    point. In this case, in addition to the prevention activities, you need to etch
    out a plan for recovery from burnout. It’s very important that you take steps
    toward recovery as soon as possible. Pushing yourself through burnout will only
    result in more damage.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re recovering
    from burnout, these are some actions that you can take: </span></p><ul><li>Identify
    what exactly is causing your feelings of burnout, and make a plan to address those
    issues.</li><li>Cut back on some of your commitments if you can. This is a good
    time to pause and reflect, and take some time off to heal.</li><li>Seek support
    from your team members, your friends or family. This is the right time to strengthen
    your support network.</li><li>Reassess your passions, interests and values. Your
    burnout might be caused by a mismatch between your values and those of the organization
    you work with, or between your goals and the opportunities you have at work.</li></ul><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though burnout is extremely unpleasant, you can
    turn it into a positive experience. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It
    can become a great opportunity to work out what is truly important to you and
    to rediscover things that you are passionate about.</span></p><p class="p1"><em><strong><span

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What causes burnout</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to note that burnout is a recognized as a health problem in the 10th revision of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</a>. It is specified as a “state of vital exhaustion” under “problems related to life-management difficulty.” And this is the key to understanding the causes of burnout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although we often think of burnout in relation to our careers, anyone who feels overworked and under-appreciated is at risk - from the CEO to the stay-at-home parent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet burnout isn’t only about how many responsibilities we’re juggling on a daily basis. Other factors that contribute to burnout are certain personality traits and your your lifestyle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, high-achieving, Type A personalities are at a higher risk for burnout. So are those who have a pessimistic view of the world, and those who take on too many responsibilities or are reluctant to delegate to others. Poor quality of sleep is also a big cause of burnout, as is a lack of a support network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to work, burnout is more likely to creep up on you when your work is either extremely predictable and monotonous, or extremely high-pressure and demanding. Lack of recognition is also a major cause of work-related burnout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their study on the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213058614000060" target="_blank"><i>Relationship between burnout and depressive symptoms</i></a>, Kirsi Ahola and her colleagues have discovered that burnout and depressive symptoms develop in parallel and cluster together. That’s probably what makes burnout so dangerous: it doesn’t come alone. Aside from depression, it also brings with it physical exhaustion, lowered immunity, frequent headaches, back pain and muscle aches.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Indicators of burnout </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The physical signs and symptoms of burnout mentioned above can be quite obvious. It’s not so, however, when it comes to the emotional and behavioural signs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emotional signs are subjective and can only be identified by the person that is experiencing burnout. These can include feelings of helplessness, dissatisfaction, a sense of failure and self-doubt, and loss of motivation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other hand, behavioural signs are much easier to spot by those around the person experiencing burnout. These are the signs team leaders should look for if they think </span>their team members are experiencing burnout: isolation, withdrawal from responsibilities, taking longer to get things done, and decreased work productivity.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What to do about burnout</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with everything, it’s preferable to prevent burnout from appearing in the first place than to treat it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prevention can involve the following actions: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting time aside for relaxing rituals, such as reading something inspirational, meditating, stretching, writing in your journal, etc.</li>
<li>Adopting healthy habits that <a title="The science behind maintaining high energy levels" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/" target="_blank">increase your energy levels</a>.</li>
<li>Learning how to <a title="How to handle stress more efficiently" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/handle-stress-efficiently/" target="_blank">handle stress more efficiently</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Delegate effectively while striving for perfection" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/" target="_blank">Delegating</a> and setting boundaries on the workload you take on.</li>
<li>Regularly disconnecting from your work and responsibilities. This includes taking regular breaks from technology.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet sometimes it’s too late to prevent burnout because we’re already past the breaking point. In this case, in addition to the prevention activities, you need to etch out a plan for recovery from burnout. It’s very important that you take steps toward recovery as soon as possible. Pushing yourself through burnout will only result in more damage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re recovering from burnout, these are some actions that you can take: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify what exactly is causing your feelings of burnout, and make a plan to address those issues.</li>
<li>Cut back on some of your commitments if you can. This is a good time to pause and reflect, and take some time off to heal.</li>
<li>Seek support from your team members, your friends or family. This is the right time to strengthen your support network.</li>
<li>Reassess your passions, interests and values. Your burnout might be caused by a mismatch between your values and those of the organization you work with, or between your goals and the opportunities you have at work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though burnout is extremely unpleasant, you can turn it into a positive experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can become a great opportunity to work out what is truly important to you and to rediscover things that you are passionate about.</span></p>
