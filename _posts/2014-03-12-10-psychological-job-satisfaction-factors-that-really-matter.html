    is unique in what they wish to achieve from their work, but there are some job
    satisfaction factors that psychologists usually agree on.</p><p>Understanding
    the psychological factors of job satisfaction will give you the ability to offer
    to your team things that are truly important to them.</p><h2><b>1. Achievement </b></h2><p>Sometimes,
    it can be hard for team members to understand what they’re contributing to the
    big picture. People feel more satisfied when they feel they are achieving something.
    Your team members need to feel that they are part of something.</p><p>Even ''small
    wins'' count. Prof. Teresa Amabile, author of the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Progress-Principle-Engagement-Creativity/dp/1455892386"
    target="_blank">The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement,
    and Creativity at Work</a> </em>has found that 28% of minor work events have a
    major impact on work life.</p><h2><b>2. Feedback </b></h2><p>Not receiving <a
    title="How to give feedback that will improve your team’s productivity" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/give-feedback-will-improve-teams-productivity/"
    target="_blank">feedback</a> on their work can be quite discouraging for most
    people. Effective feedback will help your team members know where they are and
    how they can improve.</p><p>You also need to know what kind of feedback your team
    members respond to best. Research shows that novices seek and respond to positive
    feedback, while experts respond to negative feedback.</p><p>In the case of negative
    feedback, it’s not enough to simply point out what is wrong. Explain why something
    they did isn’t working, and how it might be corrected.</p><h2><b>3. Control</b></h2><p>Pointing
    out to your team members where you want them to go is great. Mapping out the exact
    route they need to get there is not.</p><p>Autonomy and control are necessary
    for people to feel satisfied with their work. In fact, psychologists have found
    that the less control people have over their jobs, the more stressful and unsatisfying
    they find it.</p><h2><b>4. Small daily hassles </b></h2><p>Workers’ job satisfaction
    is quite sensitive to daily hassles such as unnecessary busy work, or senseless
    administrative tasks. Although they might not seem like much, day-to-day irritations
    can really affect job satisfaction.</p><p>The good news is, this is one of the
    easiest things to change, and it’s a big hit in boosting employee satisfaction.
    Take a look at your current processes and see if they can be simplified.</p><p>Ask
    your people what their daily hassles are, and address them. They will be grateful
    for it!</p><h2><b>5. Organizational support </b></h2><p>The more organizational
    support people perceive, the higher job satisfaction they experience. People want
    to know that their workplace cares about them. This can be expressed through a
    multitude of messages, from how superiors treat them, to the benefits they receive
    and other, more subtle, messages.</p><p>Even if you can’t offer your staff all
    the benefits and perks you’d like, the important thing is that they <i>perceive</i>
    their organization supports them.</p><h2><b>6. Recognition </b></h2><p>If you
    don’t recognize the accomplishments of your team, you might as well tell your
    staff that you don’t care about the work they do. And if you only communicate
    negative outcomes but don''t recognize accomplishments enough, you might discourage
    your team from taking risks.</p><p>You should definitely focus on the challenges
    your team is facing, but you should also spend some time reflecting on how much
    has already been achieved. If your team feels that their achievements matter,
    they will feel motivated to continue pursuing your company’s goals.</p><h2><b>7.
    Physical work environment</b></h2><p>Because teams will spend so much of their
    time in the office, the physical work environment can really make a difference
    in job satisfaction. But don’t think you need to plop a slide in the middle of
    your office.</p><p>A good desk, a little privacy, and separating the social and
    quiet areas will do to start with. Add in good lighting and some plants, and your
    office space is already better than many.</p><p>Take some inspiration from these
    <a title="Ultimate office layouts" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/ultimate-office-layouts/"
    target="_blank">amazing office layouts</a>.</p><h2><b>8. Flexibility</b></h2><p>Offering
    flexibility is a great way to show your team members that you trust them. What’s
    more the gift of time is one of the most appreciated workplace perks.</p><p>Smart
    people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/jobs/in-defense-of-working-mostly-from-home.html"
    target="_blank">work best</a> when they can choose their own schedule. Flexible
    hours can increase engagement and productivity. But keep in mind that they may
    decrease collaboration.</p><p>Finding a balance will depend on what your team
    is looking to achieve, but you can start with 1-2 days of remote work per week. <span
    style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p><h2><b>9. Relationship
    to immediate supervisor</b></h2><p>Great team leaders know that their staff need
    both praise for their accomplishments and recognition for their efforts. At the
    same time, team members should feel that they can always approach their immediate
    supervisors with any questions or concerns that are affecting their performance.</p><p><a
    title="How great leaders communicate" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-great-leaders-communicate/"
    target="_blank">Effective communication</a> in the relationship between team members
    and the immediate supervisor is crucial, and can make or break job satisfaction.</p><h2><b>10.
    Work-life balance </b></h2><p><a title="Work-life balance: all employers should
    encourage it [infographic]" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/employers-should-encourage-work-life-balance-infographic/"
    target="_blank">Work-life balance</a> has become a crucial element in workplace
    satisfaction. Although problems at home can impact work performance, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.57"
    target="_blank">it turns out</a> that trouble at the office is more likely to
    affect personal life.</p><p>Another important factor in well-being and work engagement
    is your team members’ ability to detach themselves from work during off-job time. <a
    href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/a0020032"
    target="_blank">A longitudinal study</a> showed that high job demands lead to
    emotional exhaustion, psychosomatic complaints and lowered work engagement. But
    detachment from work during off hours buffers the impact of job stressors on personal
    life.</p><p>Allow your team members to distance themselves from their work when
    they’re off. A no-after-hours-communication policy, except for in cases of extreme
    emergency, might work to start with.</p><p>If you’re looking to improve satisfaction
    at your workplace, try by starting with the easiest thing on this list to implement
    in your company. Whichever one you choose, even if it might not seem like much,
    know that it will be appreciated by your team members.</p><p><em><strong>What

<p>The more organizational support people perceive, the higher job satisfaction they experience. People want to know that their workplace cares about them. This can be expressed through a multitude of messages, from how superiors treat them, to the benefits they receive and other, more subtle, messages.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t offer your staff all the benefits and perks you’d like, the important thing is that they <i>perceive</i> their organization supports them.</p>
<h2><b>6. Recognition </b></h2>
<p>If you don’t recognize the accomplishments of your team, you might as well tell your staff that you don’t care about the work they do. And if you only communicate negative outcomes but don't recognize accomplishments enough, you might discourage your team from taking risks.</p>
<p>You should definitely focus on the challenges your team is facing, but you should also spend some time reflecting on how much has already been achieved. If your team feels that their achievements matter, they will feel motivated to continue pursuing your company’s goals.</p>
<h2><b>7. Physical work environment</b></h2>
<p>Because teams will spend so much of their time in the office, the physical work environment can really make a difference in job satisfaction. But don’t think you need to plop a slide in the middle of your office.</p>
<p>A good desk, a little privacy, and separating the social and quiet areas will do to start with. Add in good lighting and some plants, and your office space is already better than many.</p>

<h2><b>8. Flexibility</b></h2>
<p>Offering flexibility is a great way to show your team members that you trust them. What’s more the gift of time is one of the most appreciated workplace perks.</p>
<p>Smart people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/jobs/in-defense-of-working-mostly-from-home.html" target="_blank">work best</a> when they can choose their own schedule. Flexible hours can increase engagement and productivity. But keep in mind that they may decrease collaboration.</p>
<p>Finding a balance will depend on what your team is looking to achieve, but you can start with 1-2 days of remote work per week. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>9. Relationship to immediate supervisor</b></h2>
<p>Great team leaders know that their staff need both praise for their accomplishments and recognition for their efforts. At the same time, team members should feel that they can always approach their immediate supervisors with any questions or concerns that are affecting their performance.</p>
<p><a title="How great leaders communicate" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-great-leaders-communicate/" target="_blank">Effective communication</a> in the relationship between team members and the immediate supervisor is crucial, and can make or break job satisfaction.</p>
<h2><b>10. Work-life balance </b></h2>
<p><a title="Work-life balance: all employers should encourage it [infographic]" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/employers-should-encourage-work-life-balance-infographic/" target="_blank">Work-life balance</a> has become a crucial element in workplace satisfaction.

<p>Another important factor in well-being and work engagement is your team members’ ability to detach themselves from work during off-job time. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/a0020032" target="_blank">A longitudinal study</a> showed that high job demands lead to emotional exhaustion, psychosomatic complaints and lowered work engagement. But detachment from work during off hours buffers the impact of job stressors on personal life.</p>
<p>Allow your team members to distance themselves from their work when they’re off. A no-after-hours-communication policy, except for in cases of extreme emergency, might work to start with.</p>
