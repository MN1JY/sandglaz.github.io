<p>We will be disabling and removing functionality for Standard Grids soon in Sandglaz to provide a better experience for all users.</p>
<p>** On Jun 26th, we will be making the following changes:**</p>
<ol>
<li>All existing Standard Grids in Sandglaz will be converted to Infinity Grids.</li>
<li>Functionality to switch back to Standard grids will be removed.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Your tasks in Standard Grids are safe during the migration.</i></p>
<p>We're making this change is to simplify Sandglaz and deliver better functionality to you in terms of enhancements and improvements over the next few months.</p>
<p>** Between now and June 26th, we recommend that you convert all Standard Grids into Infinity Grids.**</p>
<h3>What's The Difference Between Infinity Grids and Standard Grids?</h3>
<p>Sandglaz Infinity Grids are more powerful versions of Standard Grids because they allow you to plan your work in time-based milestones.</p>
<p>The default milestone range is <strong>1 week</strong>.<br />
For each weekly milestone, any incomplete task automatically moves over to the next milestone for you.</p>
<p>With Infinity Grids, you also have the ability to move tasks into future milestones so you don't have to see them until the future milestone comes around.</p>
<p>This is especially useful when you know you want to work on a task, but not until next week, next month, or 6 months from now.</p>
<p>All of Sandglaz' <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/blog_posts/91-How-To-Use-Sandglaz-Tags-to-Organize-Your-Tasks">tagging functionality</a> works great in Infinity Grids.</p>
<h3>How To Convert Standard Grids to Infinity Grids</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Converting Sandglaz Standard Grids into Infinity" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>For each Standard Grid you're using, click on the grid settings then hit the 'convert to infinity' button.</p>
<p>This will convert your grid to an Infinity Grid and add a weekly milestone time dimension to it.</p>
<h3>Recap Of Changes</h3>
<p>Between now and June 26th, convert any Standard Grids into Infinity Grids.<br />
On June 26th, we're going to convert all remaining Standard Grids to Infinity Grids.</p>
<p><strong>Your tasks are safe during the migration.</strong></p>
<p>If you've got any questions or feedback about the changes, please let us know by emailing <strong>support@sandglaz.com</strong> or leaving a comment here.</p>
