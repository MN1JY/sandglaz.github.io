<p class="p1">Today we're kicking off our user chapters  series. Sandglaz users are so insanely cool that we can't keep them to ourselves. We have to share them with the world!</p>
<p class="p1">They also use Sandglaz in interesting ways, adapting it to their needs, and taking advantage of its flexibility in order to be more productive. There's a lot we've learned about how to be more productive from them and we think you will too. Today we present to you fellow Canadian entrepreneur Steve Deckert.</p>
<p><strong>Current gig:</strong> Co-founder and Marketing guy at Sweet Tooth</p>
<p><strong>Working from:</strong> Waterloo, Ontario, Canada</p>
<p><strong>Working on:</strong> Dell XPS 14Z (don't hold it against me), Google Nexus 4, Google Nexus 7</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2096" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Steve-Deckert-300x300.png" alt="Steve Deckert Sandglaz user" width="300" height="300" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tell us about yourself and the kind of work you do.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm a Canadian entrepreneur, currently working on <a title="Sweet Tooth Rewards" href="https://www.sweettoothrewards.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Tooth</a>: a loyalty app for online stores. I focus on marketing, branding, and content.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What does a typical work day look like?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Get into the office, immediately make a coffee, then sit down to clear out any emails (we use Google Apps). I use an unread/starred/everything inbox. After clearing my email I then go through my tasks in Sandglaz and prioritize my daily tasks. After that, it's working and meetings until lunch. Right after lunch is my daily ping-pong match. Following that, grab another coffee and get back to working and meetings. Have a second lunch/early dinner around 4pm (I try to eat less food, more frequently), and work until around 7pm. Repeat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How big is your team?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have 7 employees in our Waterloo headquarters, and another 8 internationally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Why did you choose Sandglaz?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sandglaz is the perfect workflow for how I set my tasks. It's a great balance between a calendar, a note taking app, and a to-do checklist.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How does it fit into your workflow?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I think of an idea or task, I like to get it recorded immediately. I don't want to think about scheduling or organizing it: I just want to get it written down. I use an "ideas" project for this (this is hidden from the "My Tasks" view.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the beginning of every week I will go through my ideas project and determine the priority of the ideas. If they can be pushed off until later, I'll move them to a later date. If I want to do that idea this week, I add it to the appropriate project (depending on what type of task it is: content, admin, etc). I'll add in any other tasks that are required this week, and then start scheduling out my week on a per-day basis by moving the task to the day that I will work on the task.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This way every day of every week has tasks assigned. Prioritization is a lot easier when you reduce the tasks that you have to prioritize. It also motivates you because you're continually clearing off the day's tasks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>How do you organize your tasks in Sandglaz?</strong> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I have the following projects: Personal tasks, Admin &amp; Internal tasks, Content tasks, and Ideas. My ideas and personal tasks are taken out of the "My Tasks" view so when I get to work I only have my work tasks to focus on.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How did Sandglaz change the way you work?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sandglaz helps me prioritize my tasks for every day of the week, and separate the "might dos" from the "must dos." Recording ideas is very important, but I find that they can distract if they live where your tasks live.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What’s the best task or project management advice that you’ve received?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Separate your goals or projects into smaller, manageable to dos. You'll work faster, procrastinate less, and feel better about the work you've done.</span></p>
