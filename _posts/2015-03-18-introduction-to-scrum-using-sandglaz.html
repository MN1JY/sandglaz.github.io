    in Sandglaz\";s:11:\"description\";s:76:\"A complete step-by-step guide to applying
    Scrum in your team using Sandglaz.\";s:7:\"content\";s:11941:\"Traditional project
    management would have you create a detailed plan of any project you work on before
    the start of the project. However, at the beginning of a project you know less
    about the problems you are solving, and as the project progresses you gain a better
    understanding of these problems. This insight was one of the drivers to the Agile
    movement and iterative software development.\n\nScrum is an agile software development
    process for iteratively managing product development. Requirements and solutions
    evolve through <a href=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/closer-look-workplace-collaboration-trends/\">collaboration</a>
    between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. With Scrum, teams deliver early,
    and then continuously improve and adjust their product in <a href=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/businesses-embrace-change-win/\">response
    to changing requirements</a>. This method of development helps the team build
    a solution that solves the customer’s need rather than meet the initial requirements.\n\nHere’s
    an in-depth guide on how to implement Scrum successfully using Sandglaz.\n<h2>The
    Scrum Team</h2>\nA Scrum team is a cross-functional self-directed team; a group
    of people with varying expertise working together towards a common goal.\n<h3>Product
    owner</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3096\" src=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/product-owner-1024x683.jpg\"
    alt=\"Startup Stock Photos\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" />\n\nThe product owner
    represents the customer. She is responsible of making sure that the team delivers
    value to the business. There can only be one product owner in a Scrum team, that
    person could also be a developer on the team, but may not also be the Scrum master.\n\nThe
    product owner needs strong communication skills, as she represents the stakeholders
    to the team, and the team to the stakeholders. She understands the customer and
    business well, and creates tasks for the Product Backlog that deliver to the customer’s
    needs. She prioritizes and organizes sprint releases and ensures that the Product
    Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear.\n\nHer responsibilities include negotiating
    priorities, scope, funding, and schedule, educating stakeholders in the development
    process, organizing milestones reviews, communicating status, announcing releases,
    and demonstrating the solution to stakeholders.\n<h3>Scrum Master</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone
    wp-image-3086 size-full\" src=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scrum-master-e1426607387736.jpg\"
    alt=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" width=\"523\" height=\"714\" />\n\nThe Scrum Master
    is the <i>servant-leader</i> of the team. She ensures that all the team’s needs
    are being met, and removes any distracting influences to help them move at full
    speed. She enforces the rules of Scrum, and challenges the team to improve. For
    examples her responsibilities include determining the definition of done for a
    project, and promoting self-organization within the team.\n\nThe Scrum Master
    is different than a project manager, as Scrum teams are self-organizing teams.
    In fact in Scrum, there shouldn’t be a project manager on the team.\n<h3>Development
    Team</h3>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3089\" src=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/team-1024x683.jpg\"
    alt=\"Startup Stock Photos\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" />\n\nThe cross-sectional
    team who do the actual work to deliver a potentially shippable product (PSI) at
    the end of each sprint. They do the analysis, design, development, tests, QA,
    documentation and all that is need to deliver the product. The team size ranges
    from 3 to 9 individuals.\n<h2>The Scrum Process</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large
    wp-image-3093\" src=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/process-1024x552.jpg\"
    alt=\"process\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" />\n\nThe goal in Scrum is to deliver
    <i>early and often</i>; starting with a minimum product and continuously improving
    it with customer and stakeholder feedback. This allows the product to evolve with
    real customers using it and evaluating it, rather than creating an initial list
    of requirements and sticking to them even if it ends up not meeting the customer’s
    needs. Moreover, it allows for flexibility to meet changes in the market.\n\nThe
    process of delivering a product in Scrum, is via iterations called sprints. At
    the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product is delivered. At the beginning
    of each sprint, the team decides on the Sprint backlog, a section of the Product
    Backlog that they will deliver in a sprint. This could be a specific feature for
    example. This section will need to be completely done by the end of the sprint;(
    implemented, tested, QA’d, etc) such that the team is confident enough to release
    it if need be.\n<h3>Product Backlog</h3>\nThe Product Backlog is the list of requirements
    for the product; it contains everything that needs to be done; features, bug fixes,
    technical work, knowledge acquisition, etc. An example of technical work is ‘install
    Windows to test on it’, an example of knowledge acquisition is ‘research a javascript
    library for <a href=\"https://github.com/Sandglaz/bootstrap-tagautocomplete\">tag
    autocomplete</a> functionality’. The product backlog is the responsibility of
    the Product Owner who maintains it based on his communication with the stakeholders
    and the team. It is a living document that continuously evolves as new information
    surfaces about the product and its customers. It is <i>dynamic, visible to everyone,
    and is the single version of truth</i>.\n\nThe Product Backlog is initially drafted
    by the Product Owner based on her understanding of the requirements, the work
    involved, and the priorities. Tasks that are to be tackled sooner should be more
    refined than those that are farther away.\n\nThis can be easily done in Sandglaz:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Start
    by adding a project</li>\n</ol>\n[screenshot of adding a project]\n<ol>\n\t<li>Set
    the column duration to match your sprint length. In Scrum a sprint is anywhere
    between 1 week and 1 month long. Experiment with your team with different Sprint
    lengths until you find what works for your team.</li>\n</ol>\n[screenshot of setting
    the milestone]\n<ol>\n\t<li>Share the backlog with your team. Share as a ‘reader’
    to stakeholders, and as an ‘editor’ with the Scrum Master and the Development
    team. This is important as the team will be self-managing their own tasks; assigning
    them to themselves, discussing them, creating additional tasks that can come up,
    etc.</li>\n</ol>\n[screenshot of sharing: highlighting the share icon in the grid
    menu, and the ‘Share With’ icon in the sharing menu]\n<ol>\n\t<li>Start adding
    tasks directly under each sprint. Don’t worry about scheduling them right (You
    can easily move them around by drag and drop) . The prioritization of tasks are
    a guess made by the Product Owner. They are expected to change. For tasks and
    ideas for much later in the future, just place them directly under “Someday”.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Tip:
    </b>quickly categorize tasks by using typing hashtags in the name (e.g. #bug,
    #investigate, #backend)\n<ol>\n\t<li>Tasks can be moved around; from sprint to
    another, from “Someday” to a specific sprint, and within the same sprint. While
    the Product Owner prioritizes the tasks, the team decides which tasks will be
    completed in a sprint and moves them accordingly. They try to select the tasks
    that can be accomplished in one sprint. Optionally, they can select some lower
    priority tasks that they will only do if there was time left in the sprint.</li>\n</ol>\n[image
    of a column with two rows called “High Priority”. “Lower Priority”.]\n\nThe tasks
    are also not to be assigned to anyone. Each team member is responsible for assigning
    tasks to themselves.\n\n[image of a task being completed with @John and autocomplete
    showing]\n<h3>Backlog refinement meeting</h3>\nThe backlog needs to be constantly
    updated and refined. Therefore it’s common to hold ongoing backlog refinement
    meetings, where the team spends their time going through tasks in the backlog
    to ensure they’re up to date. They would:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Split coarsely defined
    tasks into finer grained, well-defined tasks for coming sprints</li>\n\t<li>Merge
    tasks for better delivery</li>\n\t<li>Remove tasks that are no longer needed</li>\n\t<li>Add
    new tasks and determine whether they are needed during the upcoming sprint or
    to be left under “Someday”</li>\n\t<li>Move tasks between sprints</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sprint</h3>\nA
    sprint (or milestone) is a timeboxed effort where at the end of it the team should
    be ready with an incremental improvement on the product that is completely done:
    fully integrated, tested, documented and potentially shippable. Each sprint starts
    with a planning meeting where the team decides on the tasks to be worked on during
    that sprint. And ends with a review meeting and a retrospective meeting. The review
    meeting is to review the work that was done often demo-ing the product to stakeholders,
    while the retrospective meeting is focused on learning from the past sprint to
    improve the process.\n<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>\nThe Sprint Backlog is a part of
    the backlog that the development team must deliver by the end of the sprint. During
    a sprint no one can add tasks to the sprint backlog except for the development
    team themselves.\n\nAs the team works on the sprint they assign themselves tasks,
    and mark them as completed when they are done. They can also create subtasks,
    discuss tasks with one another, attach files and notes.\n\n[image of an expanded
    task with commenting highlighted]\n<h4>Sprint planning meeting</h4>\nIn this meeting
    the team decides on the work to be done next sprint. This meeting occurs at the
    beginning of each sprint and is typically 4 hours long for a 2 week sprint or
    8 hours long for a one month sprint. During the first half of the meeting, the
    product owner, Scrum master, and the development team discuss the priorities in
    the product backlog communicating expected development effort and business value
    of the tasks. In the second half of the meeting the development team hashes out
    the work for next sprint finalizing the sprint backlog.\n<h4>Daily Scrum meeting</h4>\nA
    timeboxed meeting that occurs each day of the sprint. It is sometimes called stand-up
    meeting, as it is common for the team to stand up during the meeting. It’s 15
    minutes long, always happening at the same time and location. The team shouldn’t
    wait for anyone who is missing. While all are welcome, only the core team members
    speak. They all come in prepared to give a quick update. Each person says what
    they worked on yesterday, what they will work on today, and any impediments that
    they see. Impediments are not to be discussed within the meeting, instead the
    Scrum Master makes a note of them and works on resolving them outside the meeting.\n<h4>Sprint
    review meeting</h4>\nThis meeting occurs at the end of each sprint and is limited
    to 4 hours. In this meeting the team demos the work to stakeholders. They review
    the work that was completed as well as that that was planned but not completed.
    Teams often discover that the <a href=\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/demystifying-8020-rule-apply-workplace-productivity/\">final
    touches take the most effort and time</a>. Partially done work should not be called
    “done”. Only fully integrated, tested, and potentially shippable work is “done”.\n<h4>Retrospective
    meeting</h4>\nFacilitated by the Scrum Master, this is a 3 hour meeting that occurs
    at the end of each sprint to reflect on the past sprint. The purpose of this meeting
    is for improving the process itself. The team discusses what went well during
    last sprint, what went wrong, and what they can do differently to improve. It
    is important that everyone gets a chance to air their opinions in an open, honest,
    and constructive atmosphere. This meeting helps build the team’s sense of ownership
    and self-management.\";s:3:\"url\";s:25:\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/\";}}"

<p>Traditional project management would have you create a detailed plan of any project you work on before the start of the project. However, at the beginning of a project you know less about the problems you are solving, and as the project progresses you gain a better understanding of these problems. This insight was one of the drivers to the Agile movement and iterative software development.</p>
<p>Scrum is an agile software development process for iteratively managing product development. Requirements and solutions evolve through <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/closer-look-workplace-collaboration-trends/">collaboration</a> between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. With Scrum, teams deliver early, and then continuously improve and adjust their product in <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/businesses-embrace-change-win/">response to changing requirements</a>. This method of development helps the team build a solution that solves the customer’s need rather than just meet the initial requirements.</p>
<p>Here’s an in-depth guide on how to implement Scrum successfully using Sandglaz.</p>
<h2>The Scrum Team</h2>
<p>A Scrum team is a cross-functional self-directed team: a group of people with varying expertise working together towards a common goal.</p>
<h3>Product Owner</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3096" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/product-owner-1024x683.jpg" alt="Startup Stock Photos" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>The Product Owner represents the customer. She is responsible of making sure that the team delivers value to the business. There can only be one Product Owner in a Scrum team, that person could also be a developer on the team, but may not also be the Scrum Master.</p>
<p>The Product Owner needs strong communication skills, as she represents the stakeholders to the team, and the team to the stakeholders. She understands the customer and business well, and creates tasks for the Product Backlog that deliver to the customer’s needs. She prioritizes and organizes sprint releases and ensures that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear.</p>
<p>Her responsibilities include negotiating priorities, scope, funding, and schedule, educating stakeholders in the development process, organizing milestones reviews, communicating status, announcing releases, and demonstrating the solution to stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Scrum Master</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3086 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/scrum-master-e1426607387736.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="523" height="714" /></p>
<p>The Scrum Master is the <i>servant-leader</i> of the team. She ensures that all the team’s needs are being met, and removes any distracting influences to help them move at full speed. She enforces the rules of Scrum, and challenges the team to improve. For examples her responsibilities include determining the definition of done for a project, and promoting self-organization within the team.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master is different than a project manager, as Scrum teams are self-organizing teams. In fact in Scrum, there shouldn’t be a project manager on the team.</p>
<h3>Development Team</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3089" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/team-1024x683.jpg" alt="Startup Stock Photos" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>The development teams is a cross-sectional team that does the actual work of delivering a potentially shippable product (PSI) at the end of each sprint. They do the analysis, design, development, tests, QA, documentation and all that is need to deliver the product. The team size ranges from 3 to 9 individuals.</p>
<h2>The Scrum Process</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3093" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/process-1024x552.jpg" alt="process" width="640" height="345" /></p>
<p>The goal in Scrum is to deliver <i>early and often</i>: starting with a minimum product and continuously improving it with customer and stakeholder feedback. This allows the product to evolve with real customers using it and evaluating it, rather than creating an initial list of requirements and sticking to them even if it ends up not meeting the customer’s needs. Moreover, it allows for flexibility to meet changes in the market.</p>
<p>The process of delivering a product in Scrum, is via iterations called sprints. At the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product is delivered. At the beginning of each sprint, the team decides on the Sprint backlog, a section of the Product Backlog that they will deliver in a sprint. This could be a specific feature for example. This section will need to be completely done by the end of the sprint such that the team is confident enough to release it if need be.</p>
<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
<p>The Product Backlog is the list of requirements for the product. It contains everything that needs to be done: features, bug fixes, technical work, knowledge acquisition, etc. An example of technical work is ‘install Windows to test on it’, an example of knowledge acquisition is ‘research a javascript library for <a href="https://github.com/Sandglaz/bootstrap-tagautocomplete">tag autocomplete</a> functionality’. The product backlog is the responsibility of the Product Owner who maintains it based on his communication with the stakeholders and the team. It is a living document that continuously evolves as new information surfaces about the product and its customers. It is <i>dynamic, visible to everyone, and is the single version of truth</i>.</p>
<p>The Product Backlog is initially drafted by the Product Owner based on her understanding of the requirements, the work involved, and the priorities. Tasks that are to be tackled sooner should be more refined than those that are farther away.</p>
<p>This can be easily done in <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/?utm_source=blog.sandglaz.com&amp;utm_campaign=ScrumInSandglaz&amp;utm_medium=blog">Sandglaz</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by adding a project</li>
<li>Set the column duration to match your sprint length. In Scrum a sprint is anywhere between 1 week and 1 month long. Experiment with your team with different Sprint lengths until you find what works for your team.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3102" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-03-17-at-2.10.33-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-17 at 2.10.33 PM" width="358" height="429" /></li>
<li>Share the backlog with your team. Share as a ‘reader’ to stakeholders, and as an ‘editor’ with the Scrum Master and the Development team. This is important as the team will be self-managing their own tasks: assigning them to themselves, discussing them, creating additional tasks that can come up, etc.</li>
<li>Start adding tasks directly under each sprint. Don’t worry about scheduling them right (You can easily move them around by drag and drop) . The prioritization of tasks are a guess made by the Product Owner. They are expected to change. For tasks and ideas for much later in the future, just place them directly under “Someday”.<b>Tip: </b>quickly categorize tasks by using typing hashtags in the name (e.g. #bug, #investigate, #backend)</li>
<li>Tasks can be moved around: from sprint to another, from “Someday” to a specific sprint, and within the same sprint. While the Product Owner prioritizes the tasks, the team decides which tasks will be completed in a sprint and moves them accordingly. They try to select the tasks that can be accomplished in one sprint. Optionally, they can select some lower priority tasks that they will only do if there was time left in the sprint. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3105" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-03-17-at-14.32.08-1024x709.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-17 at 14.32.08" width="640" height="443" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The tasks are also not to be assigned to anyone. Each team member is responsible for assigning tasks to themselves.<br />

<h3>Backlog refinement meeting</h3>
<p>The backlog needs to be constantly updated and refined. Therefore it’s common to hold ongoing backlog refinement meetings, where the team spends their time going through tasks in the backlog to ensure they’re up to date. They would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split coarsely defined tasks into finer grained, well-defined tasks for coming sprints</li>
<li>Merge tasks for better delivery</li>
<li>Remove tasks that are no longer needed</li>
<li>Add new tasks and determine whether they are needed during the upcoming sprint or to be left under “Someday”</li>
<li>Move tasks between sprints</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sprint</h3>
<p>A sprint (or milestone) is a time-boxed effort that ends with an incremental improvement to the product that is completely done: fully integrated, tested, documented and potentially shippable. The team starts each sprint starts with a planning meeting where the team decides on the tasks to be worked on during that sprint.

<h4>Sprint planning meeting</h4>

<h4>Retrospective meeting</h4>
<p>Facilitated by the Scrum Master, this is a 3 hour meeting that occurs at the end of each sprint to reflect on the past sprint. The purpose of this meeting is for improving the process itself. The team discusses what went well during last sprint, what went wrong, and what they can do differently to improve. It is important that everyone gets a chance to air their opinions in an open, honest, and constructive atmosphere. This meeting helps build the team’s sense of ownership and self-management.</p>
