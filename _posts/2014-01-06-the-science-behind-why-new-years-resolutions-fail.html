    honest: did you already fall off the wagon when it comes to your New Year's resolutions
    this year? Don't be embarrassed! You're not alone. In fact, more than 30% of resolutions
    quickly die off by the end of the second week of the year, and only 64% of them
    make it through to February. Only 8% of people who make New Year's resolutions
    are actually successful in keeping them. Most New Year's resolutions fail. \n\nSo
    why are we so bad at achieving goals that we really want to achieve? If we want
    it and it's good for us, shouldn't it naturally be easy to accomplish what we
    set out to? [Breaking a bad habit](http://blog.sandglaz.com/hacking-habit-loop/)
    is hard. Picking up a good one is even harder. And [planning](http://blog.sandglaz.com/people-suck-at-planning/)
    is almost impossible for most of us. \n\nHere's the good news: those who explicitly
    make New Year's resolutions are 10 times more likely to achieve their goals than
    people who don't. But even though we actually really want to achieve our goals,
    why is it that we so rarely manage to carry through? The key might be in looking
    at 2014's top New Year's resolutions. \n\n##Top 2014 New Year's resolutions \nHere
    are the top 10 New Years' resolutions for 2014, [according to the University of
    Scranton](http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/):\n\n1.
    \ Lose weight\n2.  Get organized\n3.  Spend less, save more\n4.  Enjoy life to
    the fullest \n5.  Stay fit and healthy \n6.  Learn something exciting \n7.  Quit
    smoking \n8.  Help others with their dreams \n9.  Fall in love \n10.  Spend more
    time with family\n\nNow that's a lot of resolutions! And I think it's safe to
    assume that some people have more than one resolution, for example, lose weight
    *and* spend more time with family. \n\nHere's the problem with these resolutions:
    they are vague, which renders them unachievable because you can't quantify them.
    My personal favourites are 'enjoy life to the fullest', 'help others with their
    dreams' and 'learn something exciting' is also one of these goals. There's nothing
    inherently wrong with these resolutions overall. But if they are not also accompanied
    by quantifiable, actionable steps, then these resolutions are bound to be part
    of the majority that fails.\n\nThe thing is, when we make New Year's resolutions,
    we think of things to last us the whole year. We think big. And there's nothing
    wrong with that, except for Rome wasn't built in a day. Taking on big, bold goals
    makes them intimidating and hard to attain, if they're not accompanied by bite-sized
    actions. \n\nAlso, the chance for positive feedback from peers, or even for the
    joy of small victories, is diminished with goals that last all year. And that
    can make many well-intentioned goal-getters a lot less motivated. \n\n##The science
    behind achieving your goals \n\nIn a Stanford experiment, professor Baba Shiv
    divided several dozen undergrads and divided them into two groups. One group was
    given a two-digit number to remember, and the other was given a seven-digit number.
    Then they were told to walk to the end of a hallway, where they were presented
    with two snack options: a bowl of fruit salad or a slice of chocolate cake. \n\nHere's
    where things get interesting: students who had to remember the seven digits were
    twice more likely to choose the cake than students who had only two digits to
    remember. This is because they are a 'cognitive load', taking up valuable space
    in the brain, overtaxing the prefrontal cortex and thus weakening willpower.  And
    making good decisions takes a lot of mindfulness and brain power. \n\nIt's easy
    to see how this applies to our broad New Year's resolutions. The bigger the goal
    (are you aware how much work must go into 'living life to the fullest'?!), the
    more taxing it is on our already over-solicited brains. \n\n##How you can improve
    your resolutions \n\nThe first step is to get away from broad, unquantifiable
    goals. [A review](https://docs.google.com/a/readyforzero.com/viewer?url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/shiltsm/pdf/Goal%2520setting%2520review%2520PDF.pdf)
    of health behaviour change and maintenance in diet and exercise shows that setting
    specific, challenging goals leads to better performance than vague goals. It's
    very likely that this also applies to areas outside of nutrition and physical
    exercise. \n\nThe lesson here is that instead of resolving to 'lose weight', you
    can set the goal of losing 10 lbs. by April. Or instead of telling yourself that
    we will 'spend more time with the family', you can make it your goal to make it
    home for family dinner every weekday. Instead of 'saving more, spending less',
    you can set up a certain  in your savings account monthly. You get the idea. \n\nAnother
    approach that is proven to help with achieving goals is formulating **implementation
    intentions**. Implementation intentions are simple 'if-then' statements. For   example,
    if your weight problems are caused by overindulging in snacks after work, then
    your implementation intention can be \"If I get a craving for chips after work,
    then I will have baby carrots instead.\" \n\nIt sounds simplistic, but these intentions
    really work. Having a clear action plan of what to do in 'emergency cases', when
    you're likely to stray from your goals, makes it more likely to take goal directed
    actions. \n\n##You can do it\nOf course, the most important ingredient of all
    this goal-setting and goal-achieving is for you to believe that you can actually
    make it happen. \n\nMake sure you foster that trust in yourself by sharing your
    goals, successes and especially setbacks with trusted, supportive friends. \n\n*So
    what are your bite-sized, quantifiable New Year's resolutions? We'd love to hear
    from you in the comments below!*\";s:3:\"url\";s:25:\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/\";}}"
