    it feels to endlessly put off your tasks. That’s because our brains are actually

    professor we mentioned above, suggests that procrastination also predicts lower
    salaries and a higher likelihood of unemployment. It also predicts other problems

    runs away from the discomfort of going through with a task that either is unpleasant
