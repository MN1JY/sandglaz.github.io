    face it. Most mornings aren''t pretty. Not all of us are morning people, yet we''ve
    had to adapt to the usual schedule of the workplace. And there are many things
    that need our attention in the morning. Chances are that the way your morning
    goes will dictate the tone for your whole day. The thing is, between all the menial
    tasks that we have to take care of in the morning and the limited time we have
    to do it all, it''s hard to find time to focus on the bigger picture and establish
    what our biggest priorities are for the day. Do these 4 things right before you
    go to sleep and start your day fresh.</p><h2>Review your day</h2><p>Before you
    say goodbye to today, make sure you review it and put in perspective the things
    that happened. Take the time to see what could have been handled in a better way,
    but also to find at least three things that you are grateful for. There''s power
    in consciously looking at the things that you''re grateful for: a 2005 study on
    gratitude showed that gratitude journals caused the longest lasting effects on
    participants'' life quality. Focus on the positive, but also on lessons learned
    for the future.</p><h2>Decide on next day''s most important tasks</h2><p>To start
    your day fresh, it''s good to have it clear in your mind what you want to accomplish.
    Of course, priorities can change during the day and it''s important to stay flexible,
    but having at least an outline of what needs to get done will make it easier for
    you to focus on those things. Take a look at your to-do list in the evening and
    see what you want to start your day with. Decide on at least three tasks (but
    no more than 5) that you absolutely must take care of tomorrow. Of course you''ll
    get more done than that - but the idea is that no matter what, you will accomplish
    these few tasks tomorrow.</p><h2>Prepare your outfit for next day</h2><p>This
    one might make you feel like you''re back in kindergarden, but choosing your outfit
    and preparing your clothes in the evening can save you a lot of headache in the
    morning. Deciding on an outfit can take between 10 to 15 minutes, according to
    a 2011 Travelodge study. Having your clothes ready will take one decision out
    of your morning routine and place it at a time where you''re not rushed to make
    a choice because of time pressures. It will also help you feel better about the
    dress choices you make, since you had actually put thought into it instead of
    throwing on the first thing you found in the closet. And the feeling of confidence
    will translate into everything you do throughout the day.</p><h2>Pack your lunch</h2><p>Packing
    your lunch the night before ensures that you have a lunch to take with you. This
    will take a load off your morning routine, and will help you sustain a healthy
    energy level throughout the day. By noon, your body will be tired and will need
    refuelling. Denying it a healthy lunch, or even worse, compensating with fatty
    or sugary foods and coffee, will reduce your focus and energy levels for the rest
    of the day. Not to mention that it will make it more likely for you to overindulge
    at dinner!</p><p>With all of these things out of the way and clarity about tomorrow,
    you can go to sleep peacefully… <strong>but don''t forget to set the alarm clock!</strong></p><p><em>Do
