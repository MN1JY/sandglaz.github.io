    people decide what task to work on first based on the closest deadline. You look
    at your task list, and you see that the due date for one of your tasks is looming
    close, so you get on to it. This is probably the most common way of organizing
    task lists and deciding what task to work on. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of
    course, deadlines are a reality of life. Your team, client or boss might hand
    you a deadline, and you have to follow it. But the problem with working on deadlines
    is that you drop everything and start churning on the most pressing tasks. You’re
    probably not putting forward your best work, and not being fully engaged with
    the work you do. And once that job is done, you move on to check “what’s due next.”
    Sounds familiar?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are other ways
    to decide what task to work on first. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tagging
    tasks using a method other than deadline can help you look at your task manager
    in a different way. Not only will you be able to get more done, but you’ll probably
    approach your work with more creativity and passion. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">So here are five different ways to decide what task to work on right
    now.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Time available</b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’ve only got 15 minutes before your next meeting,
    then you’re only going to be able to knock off quick tasks.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">But when your meetings is cancelled, your afternoon that magically
    opens up. You’ll want to scan your task manager for tasks that require longer
    periods of uninterrupted work and tackle them at this time.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Adding a time approximation using hashtags to your tasks (#short, #fullday,
    #hour) can help you figure out what to do, especially if you find yourself with
    a schedule that varies a lot from day to day. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Importance</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a
    title="How to improve your time management skills with the urgent-important matrix"
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix/" target="_blank">Eisenhower
    Matrix</a> is a way to visualize tasks on two different dimensions: urgency and
    importance. This is the basic philosophy behind the Important and Less Important
    labels.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often enough we mistake urgent
    tasks as important ones. When something has to get done by tomorrow, it’s urgent.
    But it might or might not be important. You’ll need to figure out if each task
    on your list is actually important.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tag
    your task with an importance rating by simply using a hashtag and a number (#1
    for most important and #3 for least important). Get in the habit of starting your
    day with the most important tasks and go from there.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Energy</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is your
    gas tank for the day. There is plenty to suggest that you should <a href="http://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time">manage
    your energy, not your time.</a> Time is a finite resource, but <a title="The science
    behind maintaining high energy levels" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/"
    target="_blank">energy</a> isn''t - it can be renewed and reestablished. The one
    thing that you don''t want to do though is to consistently push yourself further
    and further when your energy well is depleted. That''s a sure recipe for <a title="How

    target="_blank">burnout</a>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So on days
    where you’ve got a lot of ambitious, creative energy to dive into something big,
    you’ll only want to see big tasks.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Low
    energy tasks are better for at the end of the day or when you just don’t feel
    like moving mountains. We all have those moments - we’re all human. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Try tagging your tasks using an energy rating (#energyHi
    or #energyLo) and filter them in your task manager depending on how you find your
    energy levels that day. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Context</b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">GTD practitioners live and breathe task context.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, there’s no need to dig through tasks
    that you can only get done at home when you’re at the office.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">So every task on your list gets a context attached to it (#Home, #Office,
    #Errands, #Web) and you only scan and filter tasks based on your context.</span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Using context is an easy way to scan your long task
    lists and eliminate from your view tasks that simply can’t be done where you are.</span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Collaboration</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">It’s no secret that a lot of time is wasted in the workplace on meetings
    and colleague interruptions.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It doesn’t
    have to be that way. Use your task manager to improve how you collaborate with
    your team members.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tag team members with
    @usertags to quickly and effortlessly assign tasks. And the beauty of it is that
    you can tag more than one team member on each task.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">So you have a meeting with @sarah and @mike? Filter on their usernames
    to find the tasks that you’re all tagged in, and discuss action steps for these
    tasks. This way you can have quick, ad-hoc meetings without needing to spend too
    much preparing the agenda for each of them.</span></p><p class="p1">Try applying
    one of the above filters to your task list and you will start getting some more
    clarity on how to organize tasks and decide what task to work on.</p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">You might need to combine a few task tagging methods to make things
    work for you. Or you might find that your type of work lends itself to a specific
    type of task tagging.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just remember,
    <a title="Stop using your calendar as a task management tool" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/stop-using-your-calendar-as-a-task-manager/"
    target="_blank">don’t use your calendar as a task manager</a>!</span></p><p class="p1"><span

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try tagging your tasks using an energy rating (#energyHi or #energyLo) and filter them in your task manager depending on how you find your energy levels that day. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Context</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">GTD practitioners live and breathe task context.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, there’s no need to dig through tasks that you can only get done at home when you’re at the office.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So every task on your list gets a context attached to it (#Home, #Office, #Errands, #Web) and you only scan and filter tasks based on your context.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Using context is an easy way to scan your long task lists and eliminate from your view tasks that simply can’t be done where you are.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Collaboration</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that a lot of time is wasted in the workplace on meetings and colleague interruptions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It doesn’t have to be that way. Use your task manager to improve how you collaborate with your team members.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tag team members with @usertags to quickly and effortlessly assign tasks. And the beauty of it is that you can tag more than one team member on each task.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you have a meeting with @sarah and @mike? Filter on their usernames to find the tasks that you’re all tagged in, and discuss action steps for these tasks. This way you can have quick, ad-hoc meetings without needing to spend too much preparing the agenda for each of them.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Try applying one of the above filters to your task list and you will start getting some more clarity on how to organize tasks and decide what task to work on.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might need to combine a few task tagging methods to make things work for you. Or you might find that your type of work lends itself to a specific type of task tagging.</span></p>
