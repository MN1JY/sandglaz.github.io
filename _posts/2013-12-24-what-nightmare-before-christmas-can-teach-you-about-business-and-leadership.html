    Before Christmas has some valuable lessons for every startup or small business
    founder out there.\";s:7:\"content\";s:5263:\"When it comes to Christmas classics,
    few films compare to Tim Burton's *The Nightmare Before Christmas*.  But aside
    from the charming characters and artsy stop-motion animation, *The Nightmare Before
    Christmas* has some valuable lessons for every startup or small business founder
    out there. Whether you're planning to watch this classic over the holidays with
    some kids (yours or borrowed) or by yourself (we won't tell!), here's what the
    Pumpkin King can teach you. \n\n##It's lonely at the top \nEven though Halloween
    Town adores him, Jack Skellington feels lonely. That's because no one really understands
    the burden of being a leader. You might relate to Jack when it comes to this.
    As a startup founder or small business owner, you know that there is no one who
    can do your job but you. That's because no one can dream your business like you
    do. Most times your team won't think about your impact in the industry or the
    lives you will touch with your business the way you do. The truth is, the uphill
    journey of an entrepreneur is thrilling and exciting, but it's also lonely. \n\n##Get
    obsessed with your work...\nJack becomes fully immersed in trying to  bring Christmas
    to Halloween Town. It's all he cares about. He reads all the Christmas books he
    can find, he learns the Christmas rhymes and the carols, and he doesn't relent
    until he finds the key to implementing Christmas in Halloween Town. \n\nIn Jack
    Skellington's case, it's about becoming Santa Claus. In your case, it might not
    involve dressing in costume. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned here:
    the importance of  allowing yourself to become obsessed with your work for a while.
    Being fully immersed in what you're doing will surely give you tunnel vision for
    a while. Sometimes that's exactly what you want: to know your work inside out
    in order to come up with the most creative ideas. \n\n##...But take a break once
    in a while \nWhen Jack becomes bored with being the king of Halloween Town, he
    disappears. The whole town freaks out, and Jack is nowhere to be found. In fact,
    he goes on a long walk with his ghost dog, Zero, to clear his mind. And it's not
    surprising that he finds his next big idea during this walk: Christmas. \n\nThere
    might be times when you find yourself stuck and uninspired. When you question
    why you're doing everything in the first place. But that's when you need to understand
    the importance of leisure most, and how it can help you clear your mind. \n\n##You
    WILL be misunderstood \nJack comes back from Christmas Land full of excitement
    and ready to innovate Halloween town. Instead, his ideas are met with hesitation.
    That's because the people he's leading are single minded, but also because innovation
    is hard to accept at first. \n\nInstead of losing heart, Jack fully understands
    that he's being misunderstood and tries a different approach. To sell his team
    on Christmas and get them behind his vision, he talks to them in terms they understand.
    It's futile to tell them about the warm and fuzzies that you get at Christmas.
    So in a Steve Jobs-like presentation, he captures the audience by giving them
    what they want and know: Sandy Claws, \"a fearsome king with a deep might voice\".
    \n\n##Wear different hats \nWhen Jack Skellington is trying to figure out Christmas,
    he takes different approaches to it. He surrounds himself with all things Christmas,
    he sits in front of the Christmas tree by the fire, he tries the scientific method,
    he tries several experiments.\n\nThis is similar to Edward de Bono's Six Thinking
    Hats technique that we outlined in a previous post about [boosting creativity](http://blog.sandglaz.com/boosting-creativity-entrepreneurs/).
    \ It’s an effective parallel thinking exercise that can increase creativity by
    interrupting your current thinking patterns. When trying to find a solution to
    the problem, this technique will allow you to redirect your focus and come up
    with ideas that your personal thinking bias might not otherwise allow you to.\n\n##Delegate\nAs
    he's preparing Halloween Town for Christmas, Jack lines everyone up and gives
    them a job to do. He doesn't try to do it all himself, because he knows it's impossible.
    What's more, Jack knows everyone's strengths and weaknesses, which allows him
    to give them jobs they would most likely be successful in. \n\nAs a leader, you
    should know what your team members need to thrive, and then empower them to achieve
    that. [Delegating effectively](http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/)
    is a key part of being an entrepreneur, and it's not just about taking tasks off
    your plate. When you're delegating, you give your employees the opportunity to
    grow. This is important to your success and that of your team, because it fosters
    trust, loyalty, transparency and leads to the development of skills. \n\n##Your
    passion matters most \nEven though no one in Halloween Town really understands
    what Christmas is about, Jack gets them to follow his leadership through his sheer
    passion. Everyone participates in bringing Jack's vision of Christmas to life.
    They follow his directions and simply make it happen. \n\nThis is perhaps the
    biggest takeaway: your passion is contagious. Let it shine through and infect
    your team. \n\nWishing everyone Happy Holidays!\";s:3:\"url\";s:25:\"http://blog.sandglaz.com/\";}}"

<p>As he's preparing Halloween Town for Christmas, Jack lines everyone up and gives them a job to do. He doesn't try to do it all himself, because he knows it's impossible. What's more, Jack knows everyone's strengths and weaknesses, which allows him to give them jobs they would most likely be successful in.</p>
<p>As a leader, you should know what your team members need to thrive, and then empower them to achieve that. <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/">Delegating effectively</a> is a key part of being an entrepreneur, and it's not just about taking tasks off your plate. When you're delegating, you give your employees the opportunity to grow. This is important to your success and that of your team, because it fosters trust, loyalty, transparency and leads to the development of skills.</p>
<h2>Your passion matters most</h2>

<p>Even though no one in Halloween Town really understands what Christmas is about, Jack gets them to execute his vision through his sheer passion. Everyone participates in bringing Jack's vision of Christmas to life. They follow his directions and simply make it happen.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the biggest takeaway: your passion is contagious. Let it shine through and infect your team.</p>
<p><em>Happy Holidays everyone!</em></p>
