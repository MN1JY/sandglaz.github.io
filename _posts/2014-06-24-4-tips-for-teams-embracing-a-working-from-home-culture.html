    class="p1"><span class="s1">With smartphones, tablets, laptops, and cloud-based
    software business teams are mobile friendly in every sense of the word and can
    truly collaborate from the distance. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So
    what happens when “work from home” replaces “work at work?”</span></p><p class="p2"><!--more--></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">While distributed teams come across multiple challenges,
    these are not uncommon in teams that work together. It’s not about the physical
    distance between team members - it’s about the psychological distances. Making
    the team work well together is simply a matter of bridging the psychological distance. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">These four simple rules can improve collaboration
    for teams who are embracing working from home. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Keep communication open</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether
    it’s through chat platforms like HipChat, Skype, Sqwiggle or Kato keeping the
    <a title="Office communication tools" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/office-communication-tools/"
    target="_blank">lines of communication</a> open is one of the most important elements
    of a successful remote team. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Freddy
    leaves for a coffee run and Eddie decides to take a gym break but nobody communicates
    with each other, the team falls apart and the work culture quickly becomes sour.
    Also, make it part of your team routine to tell everyone when you’re starting
    your work day and when you’re leaving for the day. Let each other know what everyone
    is up to, from personal breaks to work-related breakthroughs. </span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Accountability and a unified presence will solidify the team and bridge
    both the physical and psychological distance between team members. </span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Establish check points and milestones</b></span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to feel adrift when you’re working from
    the comfort of your home, sans supervision and possibly surrounded by unlimited
    distractions. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep your remote team
    on track by establishing mini milestones and collaborative checkpoints throughout
    the day.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try to have a videoconference
    around lunch time to allow everyone to meet face to face, share their progress
    and discuss their projects. Invite individual team members to support each other
    in achieving goals and providing advice after the call is over. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">What the <a title="How to run a morning huddle with
    your team" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-to-run-a-morning-huddle-with-your-team/"
    target="_blank">daily morning huddl</a>e can do for teams sharing the same office
    space, the daily video call can do for your remote team. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Share the workload, literally</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">No doubt that in a shared office space, team members can combine thought
    processes and work together easier. But in spite of what Marissa Meyer might have
    you think, collaboration is not impossible in a distributed team - if anything,
    it can become even stronger than in a team that shares the workspace. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Using a shared <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/"
    target="_blank">team task management tool</a> where team members can log their
    tasks, projects and challenges throughout the day can bring back the same spirit
    of collaboration in the digital workspace (with better organization, nicer fonts,
    and endless space). </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Centralizing this
    information and making it easy to share with each other is the key ingredient
    to making your web-based working space useful.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1"><b>Refuel and recharge the batteries as needed</b></span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">People feel valued and motivated when they are simultaneously respected
    and trusted. The keyword is people: we often get too focused on workplace roles
    such as manager, associate, intern, CEO that we forget our team is made up of
    people with their own passions, interests, and lifestyles.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">Respect the individuals so that they can respect the workplace. This
    is a critical mutual relationship to foster. You shouldn’t just encourage healthy
    breaks and <a title="How to encourage your team members’ personal development"
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/encourage-staffs-personal-development/" target="_blank">personal
    development</a> activities among your team members. You should actively nurture
    and cultivate a spirit of wellbeing. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your
    team members will be grateful and motivated to put in more discretionary effort
    when they see that their workplace cares about them as individuals. </span></p><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">Happy, healthy team members make for happier and healthier
    teams.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all sounds simple right? Communicate,
    check in, share, and rejuvenate – all in a days’ work.</span></p><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">As always, discovering your team’s own quirks is a learning curve best
    traveled by trial and error.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stay focused
    on building a digital workspace that maximizes trust, happiness, and team productivity,
    and you’ll be heading in the right direction.</span></p><p><em><strong>Has your

Let each other know what everyone is up to, from personal breaks to work-related breakthroughs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Accountability and a unified presence will solidify the team and bridge both the physical and psychological distance between team members. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Establish check points and milestones</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to feel adrift when you’re working from the comfort of your home, sans supervision and possibly surrounded by unlimited distractions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep your remote team on track by establishing mini milestones and collaborative checkpoints throughout the day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try to have a videoconference around lunch time to allow everyone to meet face to face, share their progress and discuss their projects. Invite individual team members to support each other in achieving goals and providing advice after the call is over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What the <a title="How to run a morning huddle with your team" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-to-run-a-morning-huddle-with-your-team/" target="_blank">daily morning huddl</a>e can do for teams sharing the same office space, the daily video call can do for your remote team. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Share the workload, literally</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No doubt that in a shared office space, team members can combine thought processes and work together easier. But in spite of what Marissa Meyer might have you think, collaboration is not impossible in a distributed team - if anything, it can become even stronger than in a team that shares the workspace. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Using a shared <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/" target="_blank">team task management tool</a> where team members can log their tasks, projects and challenges throughout the day can bring back the same spirit of collaboration in the digital workspace (with better organization, nicer fonts, and endless space). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Centralizing this information and making it easy to share with each other is the key ingredient to making your web-based working space useful.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Refuel and recharge the batteries as needed</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People feel valued and motivated when they are simultaneously respected and trusted. The keyword is people: we often get too focused on workplace roles such as manager, associate, intern, CEO that we forget our team is made up of people with their own passions, interests, and lifestyles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Respect the individuals so that they can respect the workplace. This is a critical mutual relationship to foster. You shouldn’t just encourage healthy breaks and <a title="How to encourage your team members’ personal development" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/encourage-staffs-personal-development/" target="_blank">personal development</a> activities among your team members. You should actively nurture and cultivate a spirit of wellbeing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your team members will be grateful and motivated to put in more discretionary effort when they see that their workplace cares about them as individuals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Happy, healthy team members make for happier and healthier teams.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all sounds simple right? Communicate, check in, share, and rejuvenate – all in a days’ work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As always, discovering your team’s own quirks is a learning curve best traveled by trial and error.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stay focused on building a digital workspace that maximizes trust, happiness, and team productivity, and you’ll be heading in the right direction.</span></p>
