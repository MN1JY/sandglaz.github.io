    1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">A lot is talked about how important risk taking
    is in business, but not enough is understood about the nature and psychology of
    risk taking. Here''s where the Peltzmann effect comes into play.</span></p><p>In
    a few words, the Peltzman effect can be simply be stated this way: when people
    are regulated, they are more likely to engage in risky behaviour to compensate
    for the regulation. This effect is named after Sam Peltzman, an economics professor
    at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In 1975 he published "The
    Effectis of Automobile Safety Regulation", in which he discussed the reason why
    highway deaths had not decreased in spite of seat belt regulations. Although seat
    belts are an added safety feature, this in fact makes people feel more safe and
    more in control and thus engage in more dangerous behaviours.</p><p>People try
    to regulate the risk they face based on the circumstances they find themselves
    in. If they find themselves in risky situations, they will act in a less dangerous
    manner in order to decrease the possibility that something "bad" will happen.</p><h2>Risk
    homeostasis</h2><p>While Peltzman talked about risk compensation from an economic
    standpoint, Gerald J.S. Wilde, a professor from Queen''s University in Kingston,
    Ontario, looked at risk compensation from a psychological point of view.</p><p>Wilde
    stated that risk is an inherent part of our psychology, and that each of us needs
    a certain amount of risk. He hypothesized that each individual has their own target
    level of risk - an individual "risk thermostat". The behaviours we engage in will
    thus depend on our perceived target level of risk. If the level exceeds our target,
    we will try to reduce it down to our target through safer actions. If the levels
    falls below our target, we will try to bring it back up by engaging in more dangerous
    actions. And perhaps Wilde said it best when he extended this beyond the use of
    seat belts:</p><blockquote><p>"Risk homeostasis may thus apply not only to road
    use, but also to industrial safety, sports, making love, smoking, drinking, doing
    home repairs, climbing ladders, physical exercise, investing money, gambling,
    and who knows how many other activities”</p></blockquote><h2>So what does this
    have to do with your business?</h2><p>As a business owner, your only comfort level
    should be pushing the limits. Your limits, and your team''s limits.</p><p>Because
    what is taking risks anyway? As Richard Branson <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226942#ixzz2rmxhCK7w"
    target="_blank">says</a> , it''s simply "trying things that might not work, and
    then improvising along the way."</p><p>If you don''t try things that might not
    work, you will never come up with innovative solutions that haven''t been applied
    before. You will be following others'' solutions.</p><p>You are probably well
    aware of your own level of risk. You know what you are comfortable with and where
    you''re reaching your limits. But how comfortable are you <strong>exceeding</strong>
    your own target level of risk?</p><p>One of the most interesting quotes about
    risk taking belongs to Gary Kasparov:</p><blockquote><p> "If you don''t take risks,
    you don''t drink champagne."</p></blockquote><p>If it serves you, you can turn
    it around to say: <strong>"If you don''t take risks, your business doesn''t drink
    champagne."</strong></p><p>If you want to be able to lead a team that takes risks,
    it''s imperative to evaluate your own level of risk, and understand what holds
    you back from taking calculated risks. Chances are, if you''re not taking risks,
    you are missing out on a lot of opportunities.</p><h2>Nurturing a team of risk
    takers</h2><p>While you as the leader might be inclined to take risks on behalf
    of your business, you shouldn''t absolve your team from risk taking. As an entrepreneur,
    you''re probably already less risk averse than the general population. But how
    about your team? Are you leading a team that takes risks?</p><p>It''s very easy
    for your team members to become more and more complacent with their everyday positions
    when they know that''s what garners positive feedback. But you want your team
    to grow as your business grows, and calculated risks are necessary not only for
    you, but also for your team members.</p><blockquote><p>"A comfort zone is a beautiful
    place, but nothing ever grows there." (Anonymous)</p></blockquote><p>When it comes
    to taking risks, several emotions might be at play, depending on your team members''
    past experiences. Some of them might feel stress and anxiety caused by a fear
    of failure. That''s why it''s important that you lead by example, showing them
    that going out on a limb is desirable and helps move forward your company.</p><p>Risk
    taking is an essential part of a thriving business. Without risk taking, progress
    stagnates and ingenuity comes to an end. You can motivate your team by removing
    sources of anxiety from the workplace, and encouraging your team to take chances
    without fear of failure.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>How much of a risk-taker are
