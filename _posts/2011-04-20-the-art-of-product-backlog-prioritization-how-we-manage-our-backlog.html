    I have long been fond of iterative development, a software development practice that advocates delivering early and often to the customer, typically every one to four weeks. Prioritizing a product backlog is one big beast that has been elaborated on extensively in the software industry. In this post I will explain how we use Sandglaz to prioritize and keep track of the “stuff” we need to do, and how we eliminate the weaknesses of other prioritization methods.

    Before I indulge in the details, I’m going to go back in time and tell a story.

    “If everything is high priority then nothing is”

    I once worked in a place where issues tracked can be assigned one of three priorities <i>high</i>, <i>medium</i> or <i>low</i>. In practice, 99% of the issues were assigned <i>high</i> and 1% were assigned <i>medium</i>, none were <i>low</i>. And what this meant to the developers was <i>high</i> = do it, <i>medium</i> = ignore it. Almost everyone who worked there agreed this is not an efficient prioritization system, yet fixing it proved to be too hard. They used this system for several years!

    One of the problems here is that <i>high</i> or <i>medium</i> don’t really mean anything unless you define them. Unfortunately, the usual attempts at such definitions is a categorical description e.g. <i>high</i> is a feature that has <i>major</i> impact on the customer. In reality this only shifts the ambiguity by one layer, because terms like <i>major</i> and <i>minor</i> are just as subjective as <i>high</i> and <i>medium</i>.

    Our suggestion here is to drop this method altogether, and alternatively think of your backlog in terms of your iterations. So instead of asking yourself is this <i>high</i> or <i>low</i> priority, ask yourself is this something we want to do in <i>this</i> release <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a>, or is it a possibility for the <i>next</i> release. This removes the ambiguity entirely, and it also forces you to restrict the number of immediate tasks.

    Three more axioms to add to this:
    1. Your product backlog needs to be looked at and re-prioritized regularly <a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a>.
    2. Tasks that need to be done sooner, need to be more granular. For example if you were going to add a blog to your site in some later iteration. You jot down <i>add a blog to site</i>, but if you were going to do it in this iteration, then you will need to make several tasks for it which will include things like <i>build a blog post model</i>, <i>build a blog comments model</i>, <i>build the interface</i>, <i>build permissions</i>...etc <a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a>.
    3. Estimating accurately how much work can be done in a given time frame is nearly impossible <a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a>.

    Using a 2x3 grid, place the tasks that you plan to do in this release in the first column, the ones that are good candidates for next release in the second column, and the rest in the third column. And since we know from axiom 3 that we can’t accurately estimate how much work can be done in an iteration, you will further separate the tasks in each column into two rows. In the top row put tasks that are a release blocker, and in the second row those that won’t hold release if they did not get done. Release-blocker vs not-release-blocker is a clear way to define <i>important</i> and <i>unimportant</i>. This grid structure also provides you with a way to categorize long term priorities.

    <img alt="" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/sandglaz/images/6/backlog_prioritization.png" />

    The above grid is an example of how some tasks could be prioritized in Sandglaz’s backlog <a href="#footnote_5">[5]</a>. In the <i>Important &amp; Now</i> cell, we have tasks required to implement grid sharing. The tasks are more granular than those under <i>Important &amp; Next</i>, since they need to be worked on now.

    In the <i>Unimportant &amp; Now</i> cell we have “Add RSS feed icon to site footer”. This is an example of a task planned for this iteration, however if unforeseen problems arise and it doesn’t get done, it will not block release.

    In the <i>Important &amp; Later</i> cell, we have the task “create Sign up page”. This is an example of keeping track of a long term importance. A sign up page is a necessity for a web-based product, however you don’t want to implement it until you are out of private beta. Being restricted with the choices of <i>high</i>, <i>medium</i> or <i>low</i> priority wouldn’t have made much sense in this case.
    It is also worth noting that this task is not yet fine-grained, because it’s not being tackled today. For example, decisions like whether opening up the sign-up page should include email confirmation or not is left until the task is moved to the <i>Next</i> or <i>Now</i> columns

    Back to Axiom 1, don’t forget to prioritize and re-prioritize your backlog regularly. In addition you will need to visit it between iterations to move tasks to the left while increasing task granularity.

    If you are a small team, a start-up or working alone, this is a great lightweight way to manage your backlog. One thing I love about it is that it allows you to see the big picture all the time in one page, while easily pinpointing the priorities.

    I will also add that for this to work, or really for any iterative process to work, you will need to keep your code base production quality at all times and well unit tested.
