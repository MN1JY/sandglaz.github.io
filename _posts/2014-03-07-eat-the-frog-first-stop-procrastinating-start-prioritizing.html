    moment early in the day, then everything else will seem easy in comparison. Eat
    the frog, and everything else will be a piece of cake. </p><p>Of course, there’s
    only so much of your day you can control. Something completely unpleasant can
    happen to you at any point during the day. You don’t always have a say. But one
    area that you do have control over is the way you manage your tasks.  </p><p>When
    it comes to task management, there are several reasons why you might choose to
    eat the frog first. When you eat the frog first, you put an end to procrastination
    and begin prioritizing. </p><p>This concept was popularized by Brian Tracy in
    his book <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/1576754227"
    target="_blank">Eat That Frog! 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More
    Done in Less Time</a>.  </p><p>So let’s dissect the frog to see its impact on
    task management. </p><h2><b>What is the frog? </b></h2><p>The frog is the most
    important task. It’s also the one that you are most likely to <a title="5 Types
    of Procrastinators" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-types-of-procrastinators/"
    target="_blank">procrastinate</a> because it puts pressure on you. It’s the task
    that you know is there, but you don’t want to face. </p><p>Coincidentally, the
    frog is also a task that you should be focusing on, because it will get you closest
    to your <a title="7 goal hacks to help you achieve anything" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/7-goal-hacks-to-help-you-achieve-anything/"
    target="_blank">goals</a>. </p><p>It’s the task that sits in the not urgent/important
    grid of the <a title="Supercharge your productivity: how Sandglaz combines the
    Kanban board and the Eisenhower Matrix" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/sandglaz-kanban-eisenhower-matrix/"
    target="_blank">Eisenhower Matrix</a>, waiting for you to get around to it after
    you’re finished with all those little urgent/important tasks. </p><p>It’s the
    task that allows you to progress. </p><h2><b>What does first mean?</b> </h2><p>Some
    mean first to literally mean first thing in the morning. I disagree with this. </p><p>It
    might be that first thing in the morning is when your mind is clearest, or that
    you’re most productive in the morning. This is the case for many people, and so
    they should read this to mean “first thing in the morning”. </p><p>But there are
    also many people for whom mornings are their least productive times. You should
    eat the frog when your energy level is at its highest for the day. This might
    be at night when everything has settled down and everyone’s gone to sleep, right
    after your lunch, at the break of dawn, or anywhere in between. </p><p>For people
    who <a title="Is the 8-hour work day right for your team?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/8-hour-work-day-good-for-your-team/"
    target="_blank">work 9 to 5</a>, eating the frog at work might need to happen
    in the morning, before their day is interrupted by co-workers and meetings. </p><p>Now,
    the idea of eating the frog first is that it’s not pleasant. So don’t wait around
    for the time when you “feel” like doing the task. That time will never come, because,
    hey - it’s a frog. You’re not supposed to like it. Just close your eyes and eat
    it.  </p><h2><b>Why eat the frog? </b></h2><blockquote><p>If everything is important,
    then nothing is. </p></blockquote><p>When two tasks (or more) are given the same
    importance, your brain will choose to do the easiest one. </p><p>Let’s say you
    have “write a blog post” and “write an email” sitting side by side. Which one
    do you think you’ll choose to do first? You’re probably going to choose to write
    the email because it’s a lot easier. </p><p>Now imagine when you have 10 busy
    work tasks like “write an email” on the same level of importance as writing a
    blog post. You can see how the harder task will just slide down at the bottom
    of the list. </p><p>Eating the frog makes you prioritize which task is actually
    of value to you. It kind of forces you to face what you’d otherwise be hiding
    from. It also forces you to get on things ASAP, so that the chance for chronic
    procrastination radically decreases. </p><h2><b>How to eat the frog </b></h2><p>If
    you don’t already find frogs a delicatessen, then you will have some trouble eating
    it, no matter how much you try to rationalize that it’s good for you. </p><p>Here
    are some quick tips on how to eat the frog so it’s not <i>that </i>unpleasant. </p><h3><b>Don’t
    contemplate it too long</b></h3><p>If you stare at the frog too long, you’ll get
    intimidated and back down. You’ll find reasons to procrastinate. Just go for it.
    Don’t think about how it might feel, what might make it unpleasant, or what you’ll
    do if a piece gets stuck in your teeth. Just do the task. </p><h3><b>Identify
    highest value</b></h3><p>The frog will become more palatable if you think of all
    the benefits that you will reap from eating it. Identify the outcome with the
    highest value you will gain from completing the task, and focus on it to get you
    through completing the task. </p><h3><b>Prepare your frog the day before </b></h3><p>Prepare
    everything you need to complete the task <a title="Do these 4 things the night
    before to start your day fresh" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/things-to-do-the-night-before-to-start-your-day-fresh/"
    target="_blank">the day before</a>, so that there is no excuse when it comes down
    to eating the frog. Whatever tools and materials you need or whatever information
    you need to complete the task, prepare it way in advance. No excuses! </p><p> </p><p>After
    eating the frog a few times, you will find that it’s not that bad at all. You
    will get the satisfaction of completing a task without having had procrastinated,
    and you will be knocking down your goals one at a time. </p><p>Eat the frog first,
    and you might just find out it tastes just like chicken. </p><p><b><i>What’s your
