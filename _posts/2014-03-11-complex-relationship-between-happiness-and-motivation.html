    workers? </em></p><p>Of course, each person is fuelled by their own dreams and
    ambitions, but taking a close look at the complex relationship between happiness
    and motivation might give us a hint at what drives people to do their best work.</p><p><b
    style="font-size: 1.285714286rem; line-height: 1.6;">Are happy people more productive?</b></p><p>There
    is enough evidence, by now, to believe that happy people are more productive.
    In fact, a<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/opinion/sunday/do-happier-people-work-harder.html?_r=0"
    target="_blank"> Gallup-Healthways study</a> estimates that unhappiness among
    workers in the U.S. is costing a whopping $300 billion per year in lost productivity.</p><p><a
    href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp4645.pdf" target="_blank">A series of studies</a> by
    Andrew J. Oswald and his team also provide evidence that happiness positively
    impacts productivity. In one experiment, subjects have their happiness levels
    increased by being shown a clip of comedy routines. The subjects who had watched
    the comedy clip showed 12% greater productivity than those who had watched a ‘placebo
    clip’.</p><p>A second study by the same group of scientists took a look at major,
    real-life unhappiness shocks such as bereavement and family illness and how they
    impact productivity. In this study, a random group of subjects was given a questionnaire
    about their happiness level and possible negative life events. Then they performed
    the same tasks as the subjects in the previous experiment. It turns out that having
    had a bad life event in the previous two years lowers people’s performance by
    approximately 10%.</p><p>So, happiness can increase productivity by 12%, while
    unhappiness can decrease productivity by 10%.</p><h2><b>The role of autonomy on
    well-being and motivation</b></h2><p>One reason that might explain why happy people
    are more productive might be that people recognize changes in their energy levels
    not only as a function of physical states (illness, fatigue, etc.), but also as
    a function of psychological factors.</p><p>Simply put, people are happy when they
    subjectively believe themselves to be happy.</p><p>Scientists Richard M. Ryan
    from the University of Rochester and Christina Frederick from the University of
    Southern Utah <a href="http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1997_RyanFrederick.pdf"
    target="_blank">have taken an extensive</a> look  at the concept of subjective
    vitality as a reflection of well-being.</p><p>Ryan and Frederick argue that subjective
    vitality is enhanced when the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence
    and relatedness are satisfied. They especially emphasize the role of autonomy
    on energy levels - when the behaviour comes from one’s self, as opposed to being
    demanded to think or behave in a certain way by someone else. While autonomous
    behaviour can maintain or enhance levels of energy, controlled behaviour feels
    like a drain on personal energy.</p><p>In one study, Ryan and Frederick found
    that when samples from both a pain and a weight-loss clinic reported more controlled
    reasons for being in treatment, they showed less vitality than than those who
    had autonomous reasons for participating.</p><p>This shows that intrinsic motivation<i>
    </i>increases the level of subjective vitality, or our perceived energy level.
    Autonomy can thus foster feelings of energy and well-being. So if you want higher
    energy levels from your team members, make sure to give them autonomy over their
    own tasks.</p><h2><b>How positive emotion affects the day to day workplace </b></h2><p>Happiness
    and positive interactions can have a great impact on daily productivity in the
    office. It affects aspects of the workplace that contribute to overall satisfaction,
    and that will in turn contribute to the motivation and discretionary effort of
    the team members.</p><p><a href="http://www.stybelpeabody.com/newsite/pdf/EMOTIONALCONTAGION1.pdf"
    target="_blank">One study</a> from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley
    shows that expressing positive emotion at work radiates into three different areas.</p><p>First,
    there is a positive effect on the happy team member, regardless of her relationship
    to others. This is materialized in greater task persistence and enhanced cognitive
    functioning.</p><p>There is also a positive effect on others’ responses to that
    team member. When one team member felt and expressed positive emotions, others
    were more likely to respond favourably to that team member’s social influence
    attempts. They were also more likely to overgeneralize that person’s desirable
    traits.</p><p>Lastly, the person who is experiencing positive emotions is more
    likely to have a positive response to other team members, such as extending help
    to others.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1177" alt="the complex
    relationship beween happiness and motivation at work" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/positive-emotion-at-work.png"
    width="636" height="343" /></p><p>So not only are happy team members more productive,
    but their happiness also has positive outcomes for other workers as well.</p><p>What’s
    more, positive emotion increases optimism and perceived control. While sometimes
    this might warrant inaccurate beliefs about the future, the mere anticipation
    of success will increase task persistence. If people believe there will be a positive
    outcome, they are more likely to stick with the task when things get hard.</p><h2><b>Sadder
    but wiser</b></h2><p>There’s something to be said for those workers who might
    not be so cheerful. People are generally <a title="Planning fallacy: why people
    suck at planning" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/people-suck-at-planning/" target="_blank">bad
    at planning</a>. Our <a title="6 cognitive biases that can hurt how you work (and
    how to get rid of them)" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/6-cognitive-biases-that-can-hurt-your-work/"
    target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>, self-serving attributions and illusions
    of control make us overestimate the outcome of our actions.</p><p>Not necessarily
    so with more sombre workers. Depressed people usually have less self-serving biases
    and can give more accurate performance feedback, both on their own work and on
    the work of others. They are also more likely to accurately perceive their levels
    of control. This phenomenon is called ‘depressive realism’.</p><p>It doesn’t mean
    that people who aren’t happy can’t work well. Indeed, our happiness level might
    fluctuate throughout the day. However, people who are less satisfied with life
    might lose points when it comes to how others perceive them and how they respond
    to the needs of others.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, motivation and productivity
    don’t depend as much on happiness as they do on positive thinking. Positive thinking
    will keep you glued to the task at hand when the going gets hard, and anticipation
    of success is likely to bring about success.</p><p>So go ahead and daydream about
    what success looks like. Chances are, you will bring it within reach.</p><p><em><strong>Do

<p>There’s something to be said for those workers who might not be so cheerful. People are generally <a title="Planning fallacy: why people suck at planning" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/people-suck-at-planning/" target="_blank">bad at planning</a>. Our <a title="6 cognitive biases that can hurt how you work (and how to get rid of them)" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/6-cognitive-biases-that-can-hurt-your-work/" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>, self-serving attributions and illusions of control make us overestimate the outcome of our actions.</p>
<p>Not necessarily so with more sombre workers. Depressed people usually have less self-serving biases and can give more accurate performance feedback, both on their own work and on the work of others. They are also more likely to accurately perceive their levels of control. This phenomenon is called ‘depressive realism’.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that people who aren’t happy can’t work well. Indeed, our happiness level might fluctuate throughout the day. However, people who are less satisfied with life might lose points when it comes to how others perceive them and how they respond to the needs of others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, motivation and productivity don’t depend as much on happiness as they do on positive thinking. Positive thinking will keep you glued to the task at hand when the going gets hard, and anticipation of success is likely to bring about success.</p>
<p>So go ahead and daydream about what success looks like. Chances are, you will bring it within reach.</p>
