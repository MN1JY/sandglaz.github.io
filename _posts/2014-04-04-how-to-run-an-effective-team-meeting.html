    an important part of our working life. They are the cornerstone of collaboration,
    and in themselves, meetings are not inherently bad.</p><p>So what gives meetings
    such a bad rep? Well, for one, most of them are not run effectively. They go longer
    than they should, without a clear aim, frustrate team members and decrease their
    motivation.</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://e-meetings.verizonbusiness.com/global/en/meetingsinamerica/uswhitepaper.php"
    target="_blank">some studies</a> suggest that as much as 91% of professionals
    admit to day dreaming during meetings, and more than one third have admitted to
    dozing off.</p><p>Other professionals choose to be more productive: 73% say they
    have brought other work with them during meetings.</p><p>It’s a vicious circle.
    Boring, inefficient meetings will become even more boring and unproductive because
    team members have don’t want to participate.</p><p>Given that there are about
    11 million business meetings in the U.S. every day, there has to be a way to make
    meetings a little bit more exciting than watching paint dry.</p><p>So let’s review
    some of the things that will help you run an effective team meeting.</p><h2><b>Preparation </b></h2><p>Know
    that meetings take preparation. Respect your and your team’s time and prepare
    for the meeting.</p><p>Whoever leads the meeting should have an agenda of what
    should be accomplished during the meeting. Even though this not might be printed
    out and shared with the rest of the team, it will inform how the meeting leader
    guides the discussion.</p><p>If your meetings are lead by different team members
    every time, make it clear that preparation is a must. Go with them over what the
    expectations are and give them pointers on how to prepare ahead of the meeting.</p><h2><b>Purpose </b></h2><p>What
    is the purpose of the meeting? Is it an exchange of information? A status update?
    Are you discussing an issue? Coming up with a solution?</p><p>Set a clear objective
    for each meeting, and focus on achieving only that one purpose during the meeting.</p><p>If
    other issues come up that must be discussed as a team, take note of them but set
    them aside. Don’t allow them to derail the meeting. Then find the best way to
    follow up on them.</p><h2><b>Find the best meeting time</b></h2><p>Don’t attempt
    a meeting when you know your team members are not alert and receptive.</p><p>Every
    team has its own rhythm and so the best times for meetings will depend on that.
    But there are some things that generally hold true for most meetings.</p><p>For
    example, Mondays and Fridays are usually considered to be less optimal meeting
    days. On Monday, people are still settling in after the weekend, and on Friday
    they are anticipating the weekend.</p><p>Early morning meetings are also a bit
    tricky, because not everyone functions at their most productive in the morning.
    On the other hand, late afternoon meetings might leave you with a room of people
    who are clock watching for the end of the day.</p><p>Usually, most people feel
    sluggish right after lunch, and need a bit of time to come back to their pre-lunch
    energy levels.</p><p>So when is the best time to hold a meeting? A study by online
    scheduling service WhenIsGood suggests Tuesday at 3 p.m. works best for most teams.</p><p>Try
    out different meeting times and see when your team is most responsive. Each team
    has its own dynamics, so what works for some might not work for others.</p><h2><b>Make
    it interactive </b></h2><p>The point of a meeting is to have an exchange - of
    information, of ideas, of opinions. If you’re just talking at your team members,
    you’re missing the point. You might as well just send out an email telling them
    what you have to say.</p><p>Engage your team members with thought provoking questions.
    Get everybody to participate in the meeting and pitch in their expertise. Make
    your meetings a true collaborative feast.</p><h2><b>Wrapping up the meeting </b></h2><p>Every
    meeting should have a beginning, a middle and an end.</p><p>Finishing up your
    meeting on the right note is just as important as starting it right. First, don’t
    let the meeting go on more than needed. Short and sweet can be very productive,
    if all the end result of the meeting is crystal clear.</p><p>As much as possible,
    tie all loose ends. If there are any issues that can’t be resolved right away,
    make it clear what the next steps should be. And if you’re discussing specific
    tasks, make sure that everyone leaves the meeting clear on what they need to do.</p><p>However
    you choose to wrap up your meeting, it’s important to come to a conclusion, so
    that your team members are clear on the next steps.</p><h2><b>Reinforce the meeting
    with a written summary </b></h2><p>Unless you’re super human, your memory will
    fail you.</p><p>While you don’t need to take detailed minutes of every singe team
    meeting, it’s good to reinforce the meeting with a written summary.</p><p>You
    can write down the main points on your whiteboard, or even better, type them up
    the notes section of your <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com" target="_blank">task
    manager</a>.</p><p>Don’t forget that the purpose of a meeting is to motivate people,
    develop ideas and then move team members to take positive action toward achieving
    those ideas. Don''t get stuck on rules and bureaucracy - the most effective meeting
    will simply leave people inspired and motivated, instead of making them feel they
    just wasted their time.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have any tips on how you run
