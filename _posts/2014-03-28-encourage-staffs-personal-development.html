    amount of ongoing coaching and mentoring. Make it official so that everyone will
    be more proactive in tracking the things they learn.</li></ul><ul><li>Consider

    will help you align job duties with their personal goals.</li></ul><ul><li>Encourage

    target="_blank">mindful interruptions</a> for your team. For example, share an
    inspirational video, article or quote together when you know your team is least
    productive in the week.</li></ul><ul><li>Focus on transferable skills - those
    skills that can be applied to different areas of life, such as <a title="How great
    leaders communicate" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-great-leaders-communicate/"
    target="_blank">communication</a>, <a title="The 6 characteristics of a highly

    an office book exchange. Get some inspiration from <a href="http://littlefreelibrary.org/"
    target="_blank">Little Free Library</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Volunteer together.
    Find a cause your whole team can get behind and do something about it. Not only
    is it a great team building activity, but making a difference as a team is also
    a great morale booster.</li></ul><p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size:
    1rem;">It’s important to understand that personal development is not just about
    career development. Allow your team members to work and reflect on their lives
    as a whole. Work and personal life are not separate, they intersect and influence
    each other. </span></p><p>You are probably aware by now that even the most skilled
    professionals don’t perform well when they are worn out and jaded.</p><p>So place
    extra importance on your team members’ emotional, psychological and physical well

<p>As a team leader, you know you shape the future and direction of your team members' careers, but did you also know that you also have the power to shape other aspects of their lives as well?</p>
<p>We usually think of personal development as something that we do in our spare time to help us advance with our professional goals, in the 'real world'.</p>
<p>In fact, personal development is something that permeates every aspect of our lives. It can’t be separated from our lives at work. And people want and need meaningful work that enriches their lives beyond their day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>As Stephen Covey put it:</p>

<p>When we talk about personal development, we mainly refer to three areas that are linked together: <a title="The behaviour grid: the key to making habits stick" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/behaviour-grid-making-habits-stick/" target="_blank">habits</a>, health and career.

<p>Helping your staff develop outside of work doesn’t only help them be more fulfilled in their personal life. It will also make them more productive and successful in their current roles.</p>

<p>In many ways, assisting your staff in personal development is exactly about assisting them on the road to self-actualization, to <em><strong>becoming the person they are capable of being</strong></em>.</p>
<p>How will this benefit your company and the rest of the team?</p>

</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Encourage team members to set learning <a title="7 goal hacks to help you achieve anything" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/7-goal-hacks-to-help-you-achieve-anything/" target="_blank">goals</a>.

</ul>
<ul>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">It’s important to understand that personal development is not just about career development. Allow your team members to work and reflect on their lives as a whole. Work and personal life are not separate, they intersect and influence each other. </span></p>
<p>You are probably aware by now that even the most skilled professionals don’t perform well when they are worn out and jaded.</p>
<p>So place extra importance on your team members’ emotional, psychological and physical well being.</p>
<p>They’ll thank you for it, and your business will reap the benefits.</p>
