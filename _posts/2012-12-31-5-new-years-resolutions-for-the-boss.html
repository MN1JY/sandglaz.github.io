<p>Are you making new year's resolutions? How about to become a better boss? No doubt, your style of management has a huge impact on the performance of your team. Here are the top 5 tips you need to become a better boss in 2013.</p>
<h2>5. Keep your team challenged</h2>
<p>People (or at least the ones you want on your team) are happier and more motivated when they're being challenged and when they're learning new things. So when you feel one of your team members could take more responsibility, give it to them! It's a win-win for everyone. They'll feel trusted and valued, and you'll have a more productive team. This is easier to do in a startup environment where there is lots of work and each individual's contribution counts. Sometimes all you need to do is to keep them informed with the company's goals, and the initiative will come from them.</p>
<h2>4. Keep your door open</h2>
<p>…and your ears too! Employees want to know that they matter, and they do. They might come to you with an issue that seems minor to you, but it's probably not to them. Resist the urge to turn them down or tell them you're busy. If you do though, make sure to get back to them as soon as you can. Don't be one of those bosses who talk more than they listen.</p>
<h2>3. Balance the stick and the carrot</h2>
<p>Most bosses forget to give feedback until something goes wrong, and then they give negative feedback. But praise drives productivity, so when things go smoothly remember to tell your team that they're doing a good job. If praise comes from a customer then pass it along. When you're giving negative feedback, be constructive and very specific. Explain what they can do next time.</p>
<h2>2. Build a team of people who like one another</h2>
<p>...and are looking forward to see each other at work. This is not only done through <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com/blog_posts/67-Team-Building-Activities">team building activities</a><br />
, but also through ensuring culture fit upon hiring and creating a healthy relaxed environment. When you're hiring someone new, involve the rest of team in the hiring decision. Do whatever it takes to avoid office politics; be supportive and avoid competition between employees.</p>
<h2>1. Keep your team engaged, and seek commitment from them</h2>
<p>Engage employees by encouraging them to take initiative. This involves keeping them inline with company and team goals, and whenever possible have them come up with what course of action to take.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini" target="_blank">Robert Cialdini </a> in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X" target="_blank">'Influence: The Science of Persuasion'</a> talks about 6 laws of influence that affects people's decision making process. In Law#2 -The Law of Commitment and Consistency- he demonstrates how people's desire to be consistent with their previous actions, opinions and assertions can affect their commitment level. In other words, making a team member commit to something makes them a lot more likely to take action. Now ask yourself, what commitments do you seek from your team? How are these commitments made? And is there a better way to seek their commitment?</p>
<p>Happy New Year.</p>
