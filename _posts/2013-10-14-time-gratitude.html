<p>Today we're celebrating Canadian Thanksgiving, and as we love sharing with our readers, we want to invite you to our virtual Thanksgiving table to share in our time of gratitude. Because if we don't take the time to reflect upon what we're grateful for, we also forget what we're living for. Or, as Thorton Wilder put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There's a lot the Sandglaz team is thankful for this year.From working together to having amazing families, there's a lot of gratitude going around for us, so here we are sharing it with you.</p>
<h2>Nada Aldahleh, Co-founder and CEO</h2>
<p>I have a lot to be thankful for. I'm thankful for Zaid.</p>
<p>He is my best friend, my partner in life, my husband, and my co-founder. With Zaid beside me, I feel I can go anywhere and I can do anything.</p>
<p>I'm thankful that I have my dream job, and my dream team to do it with. They bring talent and enthusiasm. They make my every day fun.</p>
<p>I'm thankful that I wake up in the morning excited for a new day.</p>
<h2>Zaid Zawaideh, Co-founder and CTO</h2>
<p>I am thankful for my life partner and co-founder Nada. I am thankful to have a team that I am proud of at Sandglaz. I am thankful to all our customers for being part of the Sandglaz family and letting us know when we're doing things well, and not so well.</p>
<h2>Alina Vrabie, Content Writer</h2>
<p>I am grateful for many things this year. I'm grateful for graduating from both my undergrad programs last summer and I'm grateful to be able to call the Sandglaz team my team. I think few recent grads are lucky enough to say that they work within a company that encourages their development, where they are really learning constantly and where their feedback and honesty is as appreciated, and even required, as anyone else's in the company. I am also very, very thankful for my loved ones.</p>
<h2>Simon Cook, Developer</h2>
<p>As cheesy as this might sound, I am thankful for my family. Coming up to this weekend I realized I how much I am really looking forward to seeing them and getting in some good nerd games with them, and how low stress of environment coming home can be. Having such a chilled out and low drama family is something that I am very thankful for.</p>
<p><em>What are you grateful for this year? We'd love to hear from you in the comment section below. </em></p>
