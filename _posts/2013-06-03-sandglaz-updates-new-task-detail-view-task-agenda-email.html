<p>Today we launched a couple of improvements to Sandglaz that we're excited to share with you.</p>
<h3>New Task Detail View</h3>
<p>Now when you maximize any task, you'll see a large, centered task detail screen.</p>
<p>This gives you more room to edit your task details and shows you the different parts of your task.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="New Task Detail View" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></div>
<p>Here is a walkthrough of what you will see when you 'maximize' any task into the task detail view.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task Notes</strong>: Use the notes area to add additional information, links, or details to your tasks.<br />
The notes area now expands automatically for you (<em>no more scrolling!</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Due On:</strong> You can set the task due date automatically from here using an the date and time picker.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat:</strong> You can control how often the task will be repeated.</li>
<li><strong>Move To:</strong> When you set this field, you will move a task into future milestones in your infinity grid. Moving tasks to future dates takes them out of the current milestone.
<p>This is especially useful when you're planning your work and realize that you're just not going to get some tasks this week. Use 'Move To' to put them in a future milestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Task Agenda Email</h3>
<p>Many of us have a habit of checking email the very first thing in the morning when we get up or get started with our workday.</p>
<p>The Sandglaz Task Agenda Email is a snapshot of your important and overdue tasks for the week:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overdue Tasks</strong> - These tasks haven't been checked off yet and are now overdue.</li>
<li>*<em>Upcoming Private Tasks *</em> - These are incomplete private grids tasks that you've created.</li>
<li><strong>Upcoming Tasks Shared With You</strong> - These are incomplete shared grid tasks that you've been tagged on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clicking any of the tasks in your email takes you right to that task's detail view.<br />
This is handy when you realize you need to make an edit to the task, assign it to someone else, or move it to a later milestone.</p>
<p>While the default frequency for the task agenda email for all users is <em>weekly</em>, you can choose different frequencies in your <a href="https://www.sandglaz.com/users/edit">account settings</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily (Every day)</li>
<li>Weekday (M-F)</li>
<li>Weekly (Mondays)</li>
<li>Monthly (First day of the month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Try different frequencies to see what works for your working style.</p>
<p><b>Let us know what you think of the new task detail view and task agenda emails. How are they impacting your workflow?</b></p>
