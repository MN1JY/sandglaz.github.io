<p>I have recently received an email from one of our users in Gabon. He was telling me that his manager is required to travel often and that Sandglaz has been crucial in keeping them connected. What struck me about this user's testimonial is that his manager's practices have improved his efficiency and, if I may say, even his morale. He simply seemed safe that his manager is still keeping track of the projects, even while traveling the globe on business trips.</p>
<p>As a manager who travels often, you don't want your team to be stalling when you're out of the office. It's important that you surround yourself with self-starters who will automatically know what to do to further your company's interests. But even so, no matter how self-reliant your employees are, they will still need your guidance. This is just as important for you as it is for your team.</p>
<p>Sandglaz can be a centralized system for communicating with your employees while you are away. Not only will you be able to keep track of tasks and projects, but your team will also feel that you are accessible even when you're on the go. Here are a few tips for using Sandglaz to stay on top of your team projects while traveling.</p>
<h2>1. Shared grids</h2>
<p>Sharing grids with employees who are working on a specific project will allow both you and your team to stay focused, even as you are away. Your employees will be clear about the tasks that need completion and their timelines, and everyone can keep track of the project without having your inbox explode with emails. As a manager, this will also simplify managing multiple projects at once.</p>
<h2>2. User @tags</h2>
<p>User tags allow you to delegate. When you tag a team member, they will be notified by email that they have been added to that task. The beauty of it is that users can be added at any point in time, just by typing in their name on the task. Again, this will cut down the unnecessary chain of emails that would otherwise be needed to communicate this to your team.</p>
<h2>3. Touch base by adding notes on tasks</h2>
<p>You can communicate with your team and update them on changes by using the notes window in the task expanded view. The team members who are tagged in the task will receive an email telling them that the task has been changed. The notes section will allow you to stay flexible and embrace change within your projects, while conveniently communicating all of this to your team.</p>
<h2>4. Task #tags</h2>
<p>Task tags allow you to efficiently sort your tasks. This way you can see all the steps needed to complete a specific subtask. For example, let's say you are an HR manager and there are several tasks pertaining to recruitment. Using the task tag, you can sort through all the #recruitment related tasks, prioritizing and delegating them on the go. You can also see which tasks using the respective tag have already been completed.</p>
<h2>5. Keeping track of completed tasks</h2>
<p>As a manager, you want to be able to see the progress your team is making while you are away. Sandglaz allows you to keep track of completed tasks so that you can see whether your team is on track and take the necessary steps to help them achieve their goals if they're not.</p>
