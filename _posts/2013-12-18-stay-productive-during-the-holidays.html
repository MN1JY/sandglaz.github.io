    holiday season can be a lot of fun: you catch up with your family and friends,
    enjoy some time off, and probably eat more than usual. If your company closes
    down during the holidays, you''ll probably abandon all work from now until next
    year. But this will only make it harder to get back into the swing of things when
    January comes around.</p><p>Or, if you''re a freelancer or entrepreneur, you might
    be obsessing over your work, unable to take any time off to enjoy the holidays.
    This other extreme will also affect you when push comes to shove next year around,
    because you won''t have enjoyed a proper time off - which is essential to avoid
    burnout, fatigue and <a title="Boosting creativity for entrepreneurs" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/boosting-creativity-entrepreneurs/"
    target="_blank">lack of creativity</a>.</p><p>It''s important to try to keep a
    balance so that you don''t go into either extreme. If you stay productive during
    the holidays, you will find it easier to start your year in power mode. Here''s
    how you can <strong>effectively divide your time between work and play this holiday
    season</strong>.</p><h2>Make the most of your mornings</h2><p>During holidays,
    mornings will become your best ally. Maintaing (somewhat of) a schedule and waking
    up at the same time that you would during the rest of the year will allow you
    to focus on work for a few hours every day, then spend the rest of the day delving
    in holiday cheer.</p><h2>Â Shop for presents online</h2><p>There''s probably no
    greater time saver than avoiding the crowds of shoppers swamping the stores during
    the holidays. If you''re buying presents, then do yourself and your schedule a
    favour and buy them online. You''ll get the same deals (if not better) than in
    store, and it will save you a truckload of time.</p><h2>Do something you''ve wanted
    to do for a while</h2><p>Whether it''s reading a certain book, taking a new online
    course or visiting the new gallery that opened at your local art museum, use the
    extra time you might have on your hands to cross some of the items that have been
    on your personal list for a while, but haven''t had the time or energy to cross
    them off. This will make you feel personally fulfilled and will charge you with
    awesome positive energy for the year ahead.</p><h2>Put a cap on your email time</h2><p>Here''s
    a fact: emails will keep on coming, no matter whether you rush to respond to each
    of one of them or not. And we all know how much of a time devourer constantly
    replying to all of them is. Limit your email-checking hours to a certain window
    - preferably in the morning, when you''ll probably be focusing on your work anyway.
    And make it your religion not to check email outside of those hours.</p><h2>Make
    reservations in advance to beat the rush</h2><p>Whether you want to go out for
    brunch with your family or take a little trip for New Year''s, it''s time to plan
    it now. Don''t leave it till last minute or it either won''t happen or you''ll
    have to take the second best because what you wanted isn''t available anymore.</p><h2>Make
    time to exercise</h2><p>Even if you will take complete time off from everything
    else, this is the one thing you should not take a vacation from. Not only will
    exercise <a title="The science behind maintaining high energy levels" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/"
    target="_blank">keep your energy levels up</a>, but you also won''t feel bad about
    indulging in some extra holiday treats.</p><h2>Keep up with part of your work
    routine</h2><p>Keeping up with some of your work routine and staying on top of
    your industry''s news will make it easier to get back into the swing of things
    come January. It will also help you feel like time didn''t just pass you by while
    you were indulging in eggnog.</p><h2>Declutter</h2><p>Whether it''s your home,
    your office or your home office, take advantage of the slower pace of the year-end
    to declutter. Putting some order into your home and work life now will give you
    a better start next year. A clean space can bring you clarity of mind and make
    you more motivated to start your year in power mode.</p><h2>Plan your year</h2><p>It''s
