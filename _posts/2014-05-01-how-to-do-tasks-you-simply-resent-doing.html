<p>No matter how much you love your job, there are definitely certain tasks you simply resent doing.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of the time, those tasks end up being left on the back burner until the thought of them becomes so uncomfortable (usually because the deadline is getting so close) that you simply have to do something about them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thing is, the tasks we leave up in the air often cause use to feel guilty, frustrated and stressed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How much better would it be if you could simply get those things done instead of putting them off?  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These three simple tips will help you quickly expedite even the dullest tasks on your <a title="Create the to-do list that you’ll actually get done" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/create-a-to-do-list-that-youll-get-done/" target="_blank">to-do list</a>. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Embrace prevention focus </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two ways to focus on any task: promotion focus and prevention focus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Promotion focus means you’re motivated by the gains you might incur from performing the task - impressing the boss, learning new skills, etc. But if you’re feeling anxious about the possibility of failing in the task, your promotion focus will be undermined. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this case, you can turn your focus from promotion to prevention. Think to yourself: what will I lose if I <i>don’t </i>perform this task? This way, you see the task as a way to hold on to what you’ve already got, instead of thinking of how you can improve what you’ve got. Completing the task is a way of preserving your great reputation, for example. </span></p>
<p class="p2">If you focus on avoiding loss, you are more likely to see that you need to take immediate action. And probably the more worried you are, the more likely you are to get things done soon.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, this is not an ideal way of working. But if nothing else will motivate you, the thought of the negative consequences you might face <i>will</i>. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Don’t think - just do it </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes our inner critic doesn’t allow us to be productive. We end up with analysis paralysis because we just think too much. You don’t want to be analyzing things so much </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re doing a task you’re not so thrilled about, try to quiet your inner editor. Don’t think too much about how you’re doing the task, or what the end result might look later. Just do it, and correct your mistakes later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It will be a lot easier to edit your work once you actually have something to edit, than not to have any work at all. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Ignore your feelings </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you don’t <i>feel</i> like doing something. So what? Who says that you need to <i>feel</i> like doing it in order to actually <i>do it</i>? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You don’t need to be looking forward to every task on your to-do list. Frankly, that’s unattainable.  Of course, you need to be overall committed to your <a title="7 goal hacks to help you achieve anything" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/7-goal-hacks-to-help-you-achieve-anything/" target="_blank">goals</a>, but you don’t need to feel like doing every task that will get you there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, many of the world’s greatest and prolific minds relied mainly on their <a title="The productivity secrets of the world’s greatest minds" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/productivity-secrets-worlds-greatest-minds/" target="_blank">work routines</a>, and not on their feelings. They forced themselves to work no matter whether they were uninspired, or, in other instances, hungover. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Picasso put it:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next time you feel like you don’t feel like doing something, remember that you don’t need to feel like it to get things done. </span></p>
