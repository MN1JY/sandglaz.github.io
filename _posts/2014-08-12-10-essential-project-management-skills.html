    of any kind, is a project manager - whether they hold the title or not. If you
    are leading an initiative of any kind, you need to know what separates a good

    are 10 essential project management skills you need - whether they hold the title
    or not - need to be effective: </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Be
    flexible and responsive to change</span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As
    a project manager, the one thing you can always expect is to run into something
    unexpected. Based on new information you get throughout the project, you might
    have to rethink the scope of the project. You need to be able to <a title="Is

    target="_blank">let go of the initial plans</a> if it comes down to that, and
    come to terms with the fact that you will never be able to predict things exactly.
    Of course, you will need to make plans and to estimate and schedule tasks, but
    understand that your planning will never be exact. </span></p><p class="p2">Not
    only will you need to change how you manage the project, but you will probably
    need to change your approach to managing the people on your team. Staying flexible
    and open minded about all possibilities is key to choosing the best path for the
    project’s success.</p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Be likeable, yet assertive</span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">A good project manager needs to motivate people and
    keep teams working together effectively, but not be a people pleaser. As the leader
    of the project, you want to be respected and well-liked by your team members,
    but you don’t want to shy away from taking tough decisions because of how your
    team might perceive you. You need to be able to make unpopular decisions with
    grace, while keeping the team focused.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">3.
    Be results-oriented</span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A good project manager
    doesn’t only get things done efficiently and moves the team toward the goals,
    but also measures the effects of the work and analyses the results.</span></p><h2
    class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Have great communication skills</span></h2><p class="p1"><span
    class="s1">This is not just a project management skill - it applies to all management.
    You need to <a title="How great leaders communicate" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/how-great-leaders-communicate/"
    target="_blank">communicate</a> frequently and concisely with your team. Understand
    what communication tools work in specific circumstances, and how in-depth you
    need to go for your team to understand the ‘why’ of the project and the decisions
    being made. <a title="How to boost your emotional intelligence and enhance work
    relationships" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/boost-emotional-intelligence-and-enhance-work-relationships/"
    target="_blank">Emotional intelligence</a> is key in adapting your communication

    class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Have the ability to allocate resources effectively</span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">This is not just about <a title="Delegate effectively
    while striving for perfection" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/"
    target="_blank">delegating</a> tasks to people. A good project manager will understand
    that they need to find the right person for the task, communicate with that person’s
    manager if needed to make sure they are available for the project and not overwhelmed
    by the workload, and organize training or coaching if team members need additional
    skills.</span></p><h2><span class="s1">6. Be detail-oriented</span></h2><p class="p1"><span

    them in mind as the project grows or changes direction.</span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1">7. Be creative in problem solving</span></h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This
    is truly one of the key project management skills. A project manager is primarily
    a problem solver who needs to look at issues creatively and from different vantage
    points, then bring in solutions that were not obvious before. </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span
    class="s1">8. Have the ability to recognize problems before they happen </span></h2><p
    class="p1"><span class="s1">You don’t need to have a crystal ball to be a good
    project manager, but you do need to be able to recognize problems before they
    happen. Project management involves some degree of foreseeing, which really comes
    from the ability to see the details but also keep the big picture in mind. A good
    project manager will be able to anticipate problems and move swiftly to solve
    them as they arise.  </span></p><h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">9. Have the ability
