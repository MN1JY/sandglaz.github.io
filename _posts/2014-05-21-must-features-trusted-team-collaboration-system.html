    class="p1">Before we delve into the vital features of your trusted collaboration
    system, let’s take a second to look at what a trusted system really is.</p><p
    class="p3"><span class="s1">The term “trusted system” belongs to GTD philosophy.
    The human brain has a reminder system that is less than perfect, and that usually
    reminds us of things we need to do based on time and place (as opposed to what
    we actually <i>need </i>to do).</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your
    brain might work well in some settings. Let’s say you’re a construction worker
    - your brain will remind you when to perform certain tasks simply because you
    are immersed in the physical context of your work. But if you’re a knowledge worker,
    certain tasks are bound to slip out of your mind because there is no physical
    reminder of them. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">That’s why you have
    your trusted system - an external support that gives you the right reminders at
    the right time, and that gives context to your to dos. </span></p><h2 class="p3"><span
    class="s1"><b>Trusted system 2.0 </b></span></h2><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just
    as individuals need trusted systems, so do teams. In fact, the majority of time,
    we don’t work in vacuums. We work with others, our team members, and our work
    is fluid, moving between team members. It goes through different stages and iterations.
    And it requires each team member to be accountable for their own work, and for
    the work of the team as a whole. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">So
    what does your team’s trusted collaboration system need in order to be successful? </span></p><h2
    class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A bird’s eye view </b></span></h2><p class="p3"><span
    class="s1">Your trusted team collaboration system should give you the ability
    to see your tasks from different projects at one glance. In today''s dynamic workplace,
    most of us work on more than one project at a time. As we are constantly switching
    between projects, we need to have a clear view of what needs to get done.</span></p><p
    class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sandglaz-My-Tasks.png"
    alt="Sandglaz My Tasks" width="1251" height="699" /></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Also,
    each team member will probably be working on a different set of projects at any
    given time. So they will naturally need to customize which tasks from which projects
    they choose to see in their daily lists. </span></p><p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-1505" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mytasksettings.png"
    alt="mytasksettings" width="365" height="420" /></p><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Ability
    to assign tasks to your team members </b></span></h2><p class="p3"><span class="s1">This
    one seems pretty straight forward. Within your team, you need to be able to assign
    tasks - top down, bottom up and laterally. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The
    ability to assign tasks will remove the friction from your collaboration and improve
    communication between team members. Keep in mind, assigning tasks should be a
    flat process. Just as a manager is able to assign tasks to the junior, so the
    junior should be able to assign a task to the manager. </span></p><p class="p3"><img
    class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/assigned.png"
    alt="assigned" width="250" height="297" /></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let’s
    say a member of your junior team needs you to check the work she did before she
    can move on with a project. She can either pester you with emails, chase you down
    the hall (probably at a very inconvenient time for you), and let you know what
    she needs from you (at which point it’s very likely you’ll forget and have to
    ask her later). </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Or, she can add a task
    and assign it to you (which you would have done anyway in the previous example)
    and you will get notified in your trusted collaboration system.  </span></p><p
    class="p3"><span class="s1">You can see how the ability to assign tasks doesn’t
    only remove unnecessary hassles from team collaboration, it also saves communication
    time and has the potential to reduce the number of emails. </span></p><h2 class="p3"><span
    class="s1"><b>Context for your tasks </b></span></h2><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your
    trusted team collaboration system should allow you to add context to your to do
    list. This depends on each task management system, but generally you want to look
    for these three things: </span></p><ul><li><strong>the ability to classify your
    tasks other than by what project they belong to:</strong> this means that within
    a project, you can further classify these tasks. In Sandglaz, for example, you
    can do so with the use of hashtags.</li></ul><p><img class="aligncenter size-full
    wp-image-1509" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/041.png"
    alt="04" width="356" height="331" /></p><ul><li><strong>the ability to add notes
    to a task:</strong> this allows you to expand on the specifics of a task, so that
    team members understand exactly what you mean. For example, if you have a task
    related to a bug in your software, you want to be able to include all the details
    so that your team members will have the information they need.</li><li><strong>the
    ability to attach files to a task:</strong> this will not only reduce email, but
    will also keep the necessary files attached to the task they belong to. No way
    to lose a document!</li></ul><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507"
    src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/taskcontext.png" alt="taskcontext"
    width="931" height="389" /></p><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Subtasks </span></h2><p
    class="p3"><span class="s1">When you’re working on a project, it’s important not
    only to <a title="Break down goals into tasks to always achieve them" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/break-down-goals-into-tasks/"
    target="_blank">break down your goals into actionable tasks</a>, but also to further
    break down those tasks into subtasks. This allows team members to collaborate
    more easily and to efficiently delegate subtasks to each other so things get done
    faster. </span></p><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Communication in the context
    of your tasks </b></span></h2><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Being able to chat
    with other team members within the context of a task is a great time saver. That’s
    why task commenting is an essential feature of your trusted collaboration system.</span></p><p
    class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1234" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commenting.png"
    alt="Sandglaz commenting" width="969" height="193" /></p><p class="p3"> </p><p
    class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Think about it: you see a task
    in your task management tool assigned to you, but instead of going to your IM
    or email, you ask your team member a question right there and then. And when your
    team member receives the message, she doesn’t have to go search for the details
    of the task. She can see all the attached files and comments at a glance and respond
    to you right away.</span></p><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Email communication
    replacement</b></span></h2><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Email communication,
    if not used correctly, can be a huge drain on your team members’ time and efficiency.
    That’s why your trusted collaboration system should diminish email communication
    as much as possible, to the point of fully replacing it. That’s why it’s also
    important for your trusted collaboration system to also have a simple notification
    feature that is not as intrusive and disrupting as emails are. </span></p><p class="p3"><img
    class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/notifications-open.png"
    alt="notifications - open" width="579" height="350" /></p><p class="p3"><span
    class="s1">If you can do all of the above in your team task management app, then
    you’re on the right track to weaken the reliance on email as a primary means of
    communication for your team.</span></p><p class="p2">Of course, there are other
    things that are also important - for example, the ability to search through tasks,
    the ability to quickly find when a task was completed, or in what order tasks
    were completed. But the 6 mentioned above are absolutely vital for effective team
    collaboration.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3"><em><span class="s1">Photo

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your trusted team collaboration system should give you the ability to see your tasks from different projects at one glance. In today's dynamic workplace, most of us work on more than one project at a time. As we are constantly switching between projects, we need to have a clear view of what needs to get done.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Sandglaz-My-Tasks.png" alt="Sandglaz My Tasks" width="1251" height="699" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Also, each team member will probably be working on a different set of projects at any given time. So they will naturally need to customize which tasks from which projects they choose to see in their daily lists. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1505" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mytasksettings.png" alt="mytasksettings" width="365" height="420" /></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Ability to assign tasks to your team members </b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This one seems pretty straight forward. Within your team, you need to be able to assign tasks - top down, bottom up and laterally. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The ability to assign tasks will remove the friction from your collaboration and improve communication between team members. Keep in mind, assigning tasks should be a flat process. Just as a manager is able to assign tasks to the junior, so the junior should be able to assign a task to the manager. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/assigned.png" alt="assigned" width="250" height="297" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let’s say a member of your junior team needs you to check the work she did before she can move on with a project. She can either pester you with emails, chase you down the hall (probably at a very inconvenient time for you), and let you know what she needs from you (at which point it’s very likely you’ll forget and have to ask her later). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Or, she can add a task and assign it to you (which you would have done anyway in the previous example) and you will get notified in your trusted collaboration system.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can see how the ability to assign tasks doesn’t only remove unnecessary hassles from team collaboration, it also saves communication time and has the potential to reduce the number of emails. </span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Context for your tasks </b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your trusted team collaboration system should allow you to add context to your to do list. This depends on each task management system, but generally you want to look for these three things: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the ability to classify your tasks other than by what project they belong to:</strong> this means that within a project, you can further classify these tasks. In Sandglaz, for example, you can do so with the use of hashtags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/041.png" alt="04" width="356" height="331" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the ability to add notes to a task:</strong> this allows you to expand on the specifics of a task, so that team members understand exactly what you mean. For example, if you have a task related to a bug in your software, you want to be able to include all the details so that your team members will have the information they need.</li>
<li><strong>the ability to attach files to a task:</strong> this will not only reduce email, but will also keep the necessary files attached to the task they belong to. No way to lose a document!</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/taskcontext.png" alt="taskcontext" width="931" height="389" /></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Subtasks </span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you’re working on a project, it’s important not only to <a title="Break down goals into tasks to always achieve them" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/break-down-goals-into-tasks/" target="_blank">break down your goals into actionable tasks</a>, but also to further break down those tasks into subtasks. This allows team members to collaborate more easily and to efficiently delegate subtasks to each other so things get done faster. </span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Communication in the context of your tasks </b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Being able to chat with other team members within the context of a task is a great time saver. That’s why task commenting is an essential feature of your trusted collaboration system.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1234" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/commenting.png" alt="Sandglaz commenting" width="969" height="193" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Think about it: you see a task in your task management tool assigned to you, but instead of going to your IM or email, you ask your team member a question right there and then. And when your team member receives the message, she doesn’t have to go search for the details of the task. She can see all the attached files and comments at a glance and respond to you right away.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Email communication replacement</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="http://tweakyourbiz.com/management/2014/03/05/use-email-improve-teams-efficiency/" target="_blank">Email communication</a>, if not used correctly, can be a huge drain on your team members’ time and efficiency. That’s why your trusted collaboration system should diminish email communication as much as possible, to the point of fully replacing it. That’s why it’s also important for your trusted collaboration system to also have a simple notification feature that is not as intrusive and disrupting as emails are. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/notifications-open.png" alt="notifications - open" width="579" height="350" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you can do all of the above in your team task management app, then you’re on the right track to weaken the reliance on email as a primary means of communication for your team.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Of course, there are other things that are also important - for example, the ability to search through tasks, the ability to quickly find when a task was completed, or in what order tasks were completed. But the six mentioned above are absolutely vital for effective team collaboration.</p>
