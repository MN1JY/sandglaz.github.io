    style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> </span>Building a startup
    is marathon, not a sprint. A marathon that doesn’t have a definitive route, and
    no roadmap for what you’ll encounter on your way. In many ways, founding a startup
    requires the same training strategies as running a marathon.</p><h2>1. Take long
    runs on the weekends</h2><p>Marathon runners take long runs on the weekends, in
    addition to their training throughout the week, just like many startups begin
    as <a title="Quit your job without quitting" href="http://paidtoexist.com/quitting-your-job/"
    target="_blank">part-time weekend projects</a> while the founders are still working
    full-time. There’s a passion burning that’s driving them to pursue it, but making
    the exit from corporate without a well thought-out plan is scary, unsustainable,
    and perhaps even foolish.</p><p>You want to shape your project enough so that
    you don’t to end up with buyer’s remorse. Quitting your job and then feeling that
    you’ve made a huge mistake will not result in good things for you, and especially
    for your startup. You wouldn’t buy a car without test driving it, and you wouldn’t
    buy a house without making sure the foundation is stable. You want to find out
    if your idea has traction, and what better way than to take pretend you’re running
    the marathon on the weekends.</p><h2>2. Go slow</h2><p>When training for a marathon,
    runners usually go slower than their marathon pace. This is because consistent
    training at a slower pace results in better running. Even during the race, runners
    start slow so that they don’t tire out too quickly. In building a startup, it’s
    important to keep this pace to avoid burnout. Burnout has negative effects on
    everything from your health to your job performance. While building a startup,
    you want to be focused and clear headed, not running on fumes. And going slow
    also allows you to notice opportunities that come up on the way that you might
    otherwise miss if you only had the finish line in mind. Go slow and refine your
    ideas because you have a long way to go.</p><h2>3. Train on hills</h2><p>Marathon
    runners train on hills because the incline helps them prepare better. They intentionally
    create resistance just so that running the actual marathon will feel easier. In
    a startup, you simply need to embrace hills because there will be a lot of them
    along the way. Each challenge is an opportunity for learning, and the learning
    never stops. Of course, the learning curve will be steeper in the beginning, but
    just when you think you’ve solved one problem, there will be another one that
    comes up. Instead of becoming frustrated, take the resistance as a training opportunity
    that will give you an advantage in the race.</p><h2>4. It gets easier with time</h2><p>Training
    for a marathon and building a startup are both very hard at first, but get easier
    with time. Even though you will constantly be learning, your startup ‘muscles’
    will adjust and it will become easier to respond to the challenges that come up
    as you’re perfecting your technique. But exactly because it gets easier with time,
    it’s important to constantly work harder, push the boundaries and not become complacent.</p><h2>5.
    Rest and hydrate</h2><p>This one you is quite literal, although there is more
    to it than sleeping and drinking water. When you’re working 18 hours a day for
    at least your first year, it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. Getting
    the work done becomes more important than yourself, yet you are the one who is
    fuelling the work.</p><p>Long distance running requires rest and hydration. Building
    a startup requires stamina, a clear mind and creativity. To fuel these things,
    you need good sleep and water, but you also need to ‘hydrate’ your mind with knowledge
    and take care of your health so that you can maintain<a title="The science behind
    maintaining high energy levels" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-maintaining-high-energy-levels/"
    target="_blank"> high energy levels</a>.</p><h2>6. The race will start with a
    sea of runners, but few will make it to the finish line</h2><p>You start the marathon
    together with many runners - some of them your friends, some of them just other
    runners, but you will find a feeling of camaraderie like in few other places.

    teams" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/3-things-i-learnt-from-fellow-techstars-teams/"
    target="_blank">during our time in TechStars</a>. And because you’re around people
    who are going through the same things as you, knowing your limitations and knowing
    when it’s time to ask for help will become skills vital to your survival. </p><p>Finally,
    while it’s important to stay flexible, don’t undermine the need for a good action
    plan. Training for a marathon requires a hydration plan, a nutrition plan, a pace
    plan. It requires you to have enough energy to go the whole distance. If you have
    a plan on how to use the scarce resources that you have, you will be more likely
    to cross the finish line. </p><p>How are you training for the startup marathon?

<p>Building a startup is marathon, not a sprint. A marathon that doesn’t have a definitive route, and no roadmap for what you’ll encounter on your way. In many ways, founding a startup requires the same training strategies as running a marathon.</p>
