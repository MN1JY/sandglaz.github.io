    against cancer and heart disease, and it improves vision. But the biggest secret
    in your cup of tea is that it will make you more productive...";s:7:"content";s:6655:"<blockquote><p>“Drink
    your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth
    revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.”</p><p>Thich Nhat
    Hanh</p></blockquote><p>Imagine sipping a cup of tea on a cold winter day. Feel
    how it warms up your cold hands, how it breathes relaxation into your tense body.
    These are the feel-good reasons to enjoy a cup of tea, but there are lots of <strong>science-backed
    reasons to drink tea</strong> too. It can fight against free radicals that contribute
    to cancer and heart disease, and it can help improve vision. But the biggest secret
    hidden in your cup of tea is that it will make you more productive. </p><p>The
    positive effects of tea are mainly due to two ingredients, theanine and epigallocatechin-3-gallate
    (EGCG). EGCG is the most powerful antioxidant found in tea, and it lowers the
    risk of heart disease and cancer because it protects against cell damage caused
    by oxidation. Theanine is an amino acid found almost exclusively in tea. It’s
    what gives you the feeling of relaxation, because it stimulates the production
    of alpha brain waves. As if this wasn''t enough, studies have shown that tea has
    many more benefits. Here''s how tea can help you work smarter. </p><p><img class="aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-747" alt="tea increases productivity " src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_static_neverending_tea_pouring.gif"
    width="496" height="320" /></p><h2>Improves concentration</h2><p>The theanine
    in green tea is not only calming, but helps with <a title="The science behind
    concentration and improved focus" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-concentration/"
    target="_blank">focus and concentration</a>. Theanine is an amino acid that increases
    alpha brain wave activity, which in turn promotes relaxation. In combination with
    caffeine, theanine induces a feeling of concentration that lasts longer than the
    one produced by caffeine alone. That is because theanine decreases the seratonin
    levels that are artificially increased by caffeine, resulting in better speed
    perception, concentration and decreased anxiety.</p><h2>Keeps you hydrated</h2><p>Hydration
    is essential to health, and health is essential to being productive. Every cell
    in your body needs to be hydrated to function properly. Even though it’s a caffeinated
    drink, tea still contributes to our daily fluid needs. In fact, it has the same
    hydrating effects of water, with the added benefits of antioxidants, according
    to a study sponsored by the <a href="http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v61/n1/full/1602489a.html"
    target="_blank">Tea Council</a>.</p><p>In high doses, caffeine does dehydrate,
    but it is very unlikely to brew a cup of tea so strong that it dehydrates you
    - that cup of tea just wouldn’t be palatable. However, if the caffeine still has
    you concerned, you can steer clear of any possible risk by keeping your tea intake
    under 8 cups per day.</p><h2>Regulates your body temperature</h2>[caption id="attachment_749"
    align="aligncenter" width="394"]<img class="size-full wp-image-749" alt="natural
    dips in body temperature throughout the day" src="http://blog.sandglaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/i_11_p_hor_1b.jpg"
    width="394" height="163" /> by http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/[/caption]<p>Your body
    temperature fluctuates during the day as you go through your natural circadian
    cycle. It drops significantly at night, but you also experience a slight drop
    in temperature in the early to mid-afternoon, which seems to explain why we see
    a natural dip in our energy level between 1 and 3 pm. To increase alertness and
    reduce sleepiness, a cup of tea may just be what you need, as it will slightly
    increase your body temperature. </p><h2><strong>Has just enough caffeine </strong></h2><p>Before
    the end of my first year in university, I had realized that coffee gave me the
    jitters. But I still needed a caffeine kick to get me through the day. That’s
    when I realized that tea would be my salvation, especially in the afternoon when
    our bodies naturally experience a drop in energy levels.</p><p>Some say that caffeine
    from tea is better than caffeine from coffee because it is released more slowly
    in the body, but in fact tea just has less caffeine than coffee. Coffee has two
    to three times more caffeine than tea. For many people, the 135 mg of caffeine
    in an 8 oz. cup of coffee can result in headaches, indigestion or the jitters,
    and it can interfere with sleep. That’s when you turn to tea, which only contains
    30-40 mg of caffeine in the same 8 oz. cup.</p><h2>Reduces stress levels</h2><p>Sip
    on this: drinking black tea four times a day for 6 weeks can result in lower levels
    of the stress hormone cortisol after a stressful event. What’s more, people who
    drink tea are able to de-stress more quickly, according to a <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/media/library/tea"
    target="_blank">University College London study</a>. </p><h2>Makes you look younger</h2><p>White
    tea has a high count of the antioxidant polyphenol, which seems to be where the
    fountain of youth is hidden. One study showed that the antioxidants in white tea
    strengthen collagen and elastin - two factors in the development of lines and
    wrinkles. And according to <a href="http://www.journal-inflammation.com/content/8/1/27"
    target="_blank">a 2011 study</a>, tea can keep your joints younger too. Isn’t
    looking and feeling young a productivity boost in itself?</p><h2>Gives you the
    time to reflect</h2><p>If all of the above reasons seem don’t seem important enough
    to you, then let this point be your only takeaway. I can’t overemphasize the importance
    of taking time aside to reflect on your day, your week, your month, your year,
    your life.</p><p>Pausing is not a waste of time. It’s like sharpening your tools
    before you start cutting down trees. It allows you to take in your successes,
    to learn from your mistakes and to consider your future direction. It’s easy to
    overwork ourselves when we still look at the word “workaholic” as a compliment.
    But you can’t be always charging forward, almost blindly, without taking the time
    to reflect. In the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, “drink your tea slowly and reverently.”</p><p>Whether
    you like loose tea or tea bags; green, white or black tea; whether you drink it
    hot or drink it cold, tea is simply great. Not only does it have proven health
    benefits - it can also make you more productive in a smart way. I think that’s
    something we can all get behind.</p><p><em>How do you take your tea? We’d love
    to hear from you. Give us a shout in the comment section below.</em></p>";s:3:"url";s:25:"http://blog.sandglaz.com/";}}'

<blockquote>“Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.”</p>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine sipping a cup of tea on a cold winter day. Feel how it warms up your cold hands, how it breathes relaxation into your tense body. These are the feel-good reasons to enjoy a cup of tea, but there are lots of <strong>science-backed reasons to drink tea</strong> too. It can fight against free radicals that contribute to cancer and heart disease, and it can help improve vision. But the biggest secret hidden in your cup of tea is that it will make you more productive.</p>
<p>The positive effects of tea are mainly due to two ingredients, theanine and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). EGCG is the most powerful antioxidant found in tea, and it lowers the risk of heart disease and cancer because it protects against cell damage caused by oxidation. Theanine is an amino acid found almost exclusively in tea. It’s what gives you the feeling of relaxation, because it stimulates the production of alpha brain waves. As if this wasn't enough, studies have shown that tea has many more benefits. Here's how tea can help you work smarter.</p>
<h2>Improves concentration</h2>
<p>The theanine in green tea is not only calming, but helps with <a title="The science behind concentration and improved focus" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-science-behind-concentration/" target="_blank">focus and concentration</a>. Theanine is an amino acid that increases alpha brain wave activity, which in turn promotes relaxation. In combination with caffeine, theanine induces a feeling of concentration that lasts longer than the one produced by caffeine alone. That is because theanine decreases the seratonin levels that are artificially increased by caffeine, resulting in better speed perception, concentration and decreased anxiety.</p>
<h2>Keeps you hydrated</h2>
<p>Hydration is essential to health, and health is essential to being productive. Every cell in your body needs to be hydrated to function properly. Even though it’s a caffeinated drink, tea still contributes to our daily fluid needs. In fact, it has the same hydrating effects of water, with the added benefits of antioxidants, according to a study sponsored by the <a href="http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v61/n1/full/1602489a.html" target="_blank">Tea Council</a>.</p>
<p>In high doses, caffeine does dehydrate, but it is very unlikely to brew a cup of tea so strong that it dehydrates you - that cup of tea just wouldn’t be palatable. However, if the caffeine still has you concerned, you can steer clear of any possible risk by keeping your tea intake under 8 cups per day.</p>
<h2>Regulates your body temperature</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_749" align="aligncenter" width="394"]<img class="size-full wp-image-749" alt="natural dips in body temperature throughout the day" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/i_11_p_hor_1b.jpg" width="394" height="163" /> by http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/[/caption]</p>
<p>Your body temperature fluctuates during the day as you go through your natural circadian cycle. It drops significantly at night, but you also experience a slight drop in temperature in the early to mid-afternoon, which seems to explain why we see a natural dip in our energy level between 1 and 3 pm. To increase alertness and reduce sleepiness, a cup of tea may just be what you need, as it will slightly increase your body temperature.</p>
<h2><strong>Has just enough caffeine </strong></h2>
<p>Before the end of my first year in university, I had realized that coffee gave me the jitters. But I still needed a caffeine kick to get me through the day. That’s when I realized that tea would be my salvation, especially in the afternoon when our bodies naturally experience a drop in energy levels.</p>
<p>Some say that caffeine from tea is better than caffeine from coffee because it is released more slowly in the body, but in fact tea just has less caffeine than coffee. Coffee has two to three times more caffeine than tea. For many people, the 135 mg of caffeine in an 8 oz. cup of coffee can result in headaches, indigestion or the jitters, and it can interfere with sleep. That’s when you turn to tea, which only contains 30-40 mg of caffeine in the same 8 oz. cup.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter" alt="tea increases productivity " src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_static_neverending_tea_pouring.gif" width="496" height="320" /></h2>
<h2>Reduces stress levels</h2>
<p>Sip on this: drinking black tea four times a day for 6 weeks can result in lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol after a stressful event. What’s more, people who drink tea are able to de-stress more quickly, according to a <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/media/library/tea" target="_blank">University College London study</a>.</p>
<h2>Makes you look younger</h2>
<p>White tea has a high count of the antioxidant polyphenol, which seems to be where the fountain of youth is hidden. One study showed that the antioxidants in white tea strengthen collagen and elastin - two factors in the development of lines and wrinkles. And according to <a href="http://www.journal-inflammation.com/content/8/1/27" target="_blank">a 2011 study</a>, tea can keep your joints younger too. Isn’t looking and feeling young a productivity boost in itself?</p>
<h2>Gives you the time to reflect</h2>
<p>If all of the above reasons seem don’t seem important enough to you, then let this point be your only takeaway. I can’t overemphasize the importance of taking time aside to reflect on your day, your week, your month, your year, your life.</p>
<p>Pausing is not a waste of time. It’s like sharpening your tools before you start cutting down trees. It allows you to take in your successes, to learn from your mistakes and to consider your future direction. It’s easy to overwork ourselves when we still look at the word “workaholic” as a compliment. But you can’t be always charging forward, almost blindly, without taking the time to reflect. In the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, “drink your tea slowly and reverently.”</p>
<p>Whether you like loose tea or tea bags; green, white or black tea; whether you drink it hot or drink it cold, tea is simply great. Not only does it have proven health benefits - it can also make you more productive in a smart way. I think that’s something we can all get behind.</p>
