    tasks management tips from 6 superachievers";s:11:"description";s:146:"These 6
    superachievers all have one thing in common: they’ve learnt to work smarter, not
    harder. They’ve perfected the art of task management.";s:7:"content";s:10725:"<p>In
    a recent blog post, we talked about <a title="Startup tips from today’s biggest
    business legends" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/startup-tips-business-legends/"
    target="_blank">three business legends</a> and their tips for startups. Ingvar
    Kamprad, Steve Jobs, and Richard Branson all built massive empires from modest
    beginnings. Their companies are now giants of the business world, but they started
    out small, too.</p><p>Superachievers like Kamprad, Jobs and Branson all have one
    thing in common: they’ve learnt that the key to success is not about working harder,
    but working smarter. They’ve perfected the art of task management.</p><p>If there’s
    one truth that applies to the business world, it’s that entrepreneurs are always
    busy. Especially in the early days, it’s difficult to take a break, to slow down.
    You aim for a milestone and think that after you reach it you can take it easy
    for a while, but the truth is you won’t get any less busy. As you become more
    successful you’ll just have more and more to do.</p><p>Or will you?</p><p>This
    is where task management comes in. For you to be able to work productively while
    staying in good health and maintaining a work-life balance, you need to manage
    your time; manage your energy; and manage your tasks.</p><p>Jim Rohn calls time
    management “the best-kept secret of the rich.” We all have the same number of
    hours in a day. However, what we choose to do with them is often the difference
    between success and failure.</p><p>Most of today’s most successful people achieved
    success not by doing more, but by evaluating what’s important and focusing on
    a select few tasks. In short, they learn how to cut away distractions, how to
    stop wasting time on menial activities, and how to stay focused on what’s important.</p><p>Today
    we’re going to take a look at the task management secrets of six superachievers.
    Starting with our three aforementioned business legends - Kamprad, Jobs and Branson
    - we’re going to examine how smart task management is the key to getting ahead:</p><h2><b>Richard
    Branson, master of delegation</b></h2><p>Richard Branson started his first business
    venture when he was 16. By the time he was 23, he had opened several record stores,
    opened a Virgin recording studio, launched Virgin Records, and made his first
    million.</p><p>From the very start, Branson knew that to successfully manage such
    a large and complex business, he had to <a title="Delegate effectively while striving
    for perfection" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/"
    target="_blank">learn how to delegate</a>. With hundreds of businesses as part
    of the Virgin Group, Branson relies on a terrific team to help him run all of
    Virgin’s operations. And that’s something he’s done from <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219988"
    target="_blank">day one</a>.</p><p>A key part of task management is not trying
    to do everything yourself. The best leaders are the ones who recognize their own
    limitations and hire someone else who can do the job better. Learning how to ask
    for help, delegate, and trust others with important work are all important ingredients
    for your business to grow.</p><h2><b>Steve Jobs: simple is beautiful</b></h2><p>Steve
    Jobs has valuable lessons to teach pretty much everyone. From genius marketing
    to beautiful design to revolutionary technology, Jobs was the tech guru most of
    us want to be.</p><p>The most important task management tip he has to teach us
    is perhaps the one that imbued every aspect of his work: <a href="http://www.applegazette.com/ipod/steve-jobs-and-minimalism/">keep
    things simple</a>. This allowed him to create beautiful, easy-to-use objects that
    people intuitively knew how to use. Take the iPod: a simple rectangular device
    with a screen and a circular controller, any child could pick it up and understand
    how to use it.</p><p>His philosophy of minimalism didn’t only shape his design
    aesthetic, it also characterized his personal life. For Jobs, if something was
    a distraction, it had to go.</p><p>This gave him the quiet needed to focus on
    his most important tasks. Jobs’ preoccupation with simplicity went to the extreme
    of him having almost no furniture in his apartment. Without any superfluous clutter
    surrounding him, he could concentrate on what mattered.</p><h2><b>Ingvar Kamprad
    and time management</b></h2><p>In the early days of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad was already
    a master of efficiency. He started IKEA as a mail-order business from the small
    village of Agunnaryd in 1943, getting up at 6 AM every day.</p><p>To best tackle
    projects and finish tasks, Kamprad believed that we should all divide our lives
    into <a href="https://sweden.se/business/ingvar-kamprad-founder-of-ikea/" target="_blank">10
    minute units</a>, and sacrifice as few of them as possible on meaningless activity.</p><p>Hmm,
    maybe news of the <a title="Can tomatoes make you more productive?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/can-tomatoes-make-you-more-productive/"
    target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a> reached Kamprad all the way to his tiny
    village in rural Sweden...</p><h2><b>Dr. Oz and energy management</b></h2><p>Dr.
    Mehmet Oz is a busy guy. Not only does he perform 250 open-heart surgeries a year
    and host his own TV show, he’s also a professor, a chairman of surgery, a prolific
    writer, and a devoted family man with four kids.</p><p>His task management secret
    is similar to Ingvar Kamprad’s. However rather than focusing on time management,
    he focuses on energy management.</p><p>In other words, he tries to devote his
    time to tasks that energize and inspire him. “The things you do in your life should
    give you that zest for life,” he says.</p><p>Everybody has natural<a title="Take
    advantage of productivity peaks and find your daily rhythm" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/take-advantage-productivity-peaks-find-your-daily-rhythm/"
    target="_blank"> highs and lows of energy</a> that dictate when we work best;
    for some of us mornings are sacred, for others the late hours of the night are
    when they’re most productive. For Dr. Oz, managing his tasks well means taking
    these moment of high energy, maximizing them, and cutting out tasks that drag
    down his energy instead of boosting it.</p><h2><b>Darren Hardy: doing less to
    get ahead</b></h2><p>Darren Hardy - publisher, director, and mentor of CEOs and
    entrepreneurs - has a problem that many of us have as well. <a href="http://www.success.com/article/accomplish-more-by-doing-less"
    target="_blank">He’s an addict</a>.</p><p>So what’s his drug of choice? Not drugs
    or coffee or alcohol as you may think, but constant movement, constant communication,
    and constant achievement.</p><p>This addiction to perpetual busyness is one that’s
    all the more common among professional men and women. Caught up in a whirlwind
    of phone-calls, deadlines, emails, and assignments, it’s easy to <a title="4 life
    hacks to help you stop multitasking" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/"
    target="_blank">slip into the cycle of being busy but not productive</a>.</p><p>Darren
    Hardy realized that to get ahead, he can’t just keep doing more: doing so is incredibly
    taxing to your physical, psychological, and emotional system. Also, it’s not sustainable;
    sooner or later, if you don’t take a physical break, you’ll end up taking a mental
    one, simply going through the motions of your job without really being there.</p><p>So
    to get ahead, Hardy realized that he actually needs to start doing less. He needed
    to shorten his to-do list, focus on a handful of important tasks, and put the
    rest aside. He found ways to stop being busy and start being productive.</p><p>One
    of his strategies is using the <a title="4 life hacks to help you stop multitasking"
    href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/">80/20 rule</a>: 20%
    of the work you do is responsible for 80% of your impact and effectiveness. Hardy
    identified the 20% and concentrated on it. The result? A more balanced lifestyle.</p><h2><b>President
    Obama and the economy of decision-making</b></h2><p>The brain consumes 20% more
    energy when it’s thinking. Over the course of a day, you make countless decisions
    that all require a fair amount of energy. Some of these decisions are more important.
    Some are fairly redundant.</p><p>For every decision you make, <a title="How to
    improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/">your
    future decisions-making ability is eroded</a>. Psychologists call this decision
    fatigue. It’s the reason that judges for example give harsher rulings later on
    in the day.</p><p>So <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3026265/work-smart/always-wear-the-same-suit-obamas-presidential-productivity-secrets"
    target="_blank">wear the same suit</a>.</p><p>President Obama always wears a blue
    or a grey suit because he doesn’t want to waste decision-making energy on what
    to wear. “I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because
    I have too many other decisions to make,” he says.</p><p>Obama uses the same type
    of methodical process when it comes to decision memos. Preferring written advice
    to spoken, he has his team members deliver memos to his desk with three checkboxes
    at the bottom:</p><ul><li style="list-style: url(''http://nadeausoftware.com/sites/nadeausoftware.com/files/bullets/emptysquare_10x10_large.gif'');">agree</li><li
    style="list-style: url(''http://nadeausoftware.com/sites/nadeausoftware.com/files/bullets/emptysquare_10x10_large.gif'');">disagree</li><li
    style="list-style: url(''http://nadeausoftware.com/sites/nadeausoftware.com/files/bullets/emptysquare_10x10_large.gif'');">let''s
    discuss</li></ul><p>He then selects one of the boxes and communicates his choice
    to his team members. This process speeds up the feedback loop by breaking down
    decision-making into three simple choices.</p><p>Having a set routine for what
    you wear, what you eat, and how you handle other daily tasks is an amazing time-saver.
    It reduces the friction in your days and lets you focus on the really important
    decisions. When you’re working, it’s valuable; when you’re president, it’s a necessity.</p><p><b><i>Have

<p>In a recent blog post, we talked about <a title="Startup tips from today’s biggest business legends" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/startup-tips-business-legends/" target="_blank">three business legends</a> and their tips for startups. Ingvar Kamprad, Steve Jobs, and Richard Branson all built massive empires from modest beginnings. Their companies are now giants of the business world, but they started out small, too.</p>
<p>Superachievers like Kamprad, Jobs and Branson all have one thing in common: they’ve learnt that the key to success is not about working harder, but working smarter. They’ve perfected the art of task management.</p>
<p>If there’s one truth that applies to the business world, it’s that entrepreneurs are always busy. Especially in the early days, it’s difficult to take a break, to slow down. You aim for a milestone and think that after you reach it you can take it easy for a while, but the truth is you won’t get any less busy. As you become more successful you’ll just have more and more to do.</p>
<p>Or will you?</p>
<p>This is where task management comes in. For you to be able to work productively while staying in good health and maintaining a work-life balance, you need to manage your time; manage your energy; and manage your tasks.</p>
<p>Jim Rohn calls time management “the best-kept secret of the rich.” We all have the same number of hours in a day. However, what we choose to do with them is often the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>Most of today’s most successful people achieved success not by doing more, but by evaluating what’s important and focusing on a select few tasks. In short, they learn how to cut away distractions, how to stop wasting time on menial activities, and how to stay focused on what’s important.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to take a look at the best task management tips of six superachievers. Starting with our three aforementioned business legends - Kamprad, Jobs and Branson - we’re going to examine how smart task management is the key to getting ahead:</p>
<h2><b>Richard Branson, master of delegation</b></h2>
<p>Richard Branson started his first business venture when he was 16. By the time he was 23, he had opened several record stores, opened a Virgin recording studio, launched Virgin Records, and made his first million.</p>
<p>From the very start, Branson knew that to successfully manage such a large and complex business, he had to <a title="Delegate effectively while striving for perfection" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/delegate-effectively-while-striving-for-perfection/" target="_blank">learn how to delegate</a>. With hundreds of businesses as part of the Virgin Group, Branson relies on a terrific team to help him run all of Virgin’s operations. And that’s something he’s done from <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219988" target="_blank">day one</a>.</p>
<p>A key part of task management is not trying to do everything yourself. The best leaders are the ones who recognize their own limitations and hire someone else who can do the job better. Learning how to ask for help, delegate, and trust others with important work are all important ingredients for your business to grow.</p>
<h2><b>Steve Jobs: simple is beautiful</b></h2>
<p>Steve Jobs has valuable lessons to teach pretty much everyone. From genius marketing to beautiful design to revolutionary technology, Jobs was the tech guru most of us want to be.</p>
<p>The most important task management tip he has to teach us is perhaps the one that imbued every aspect of his work: <a href="http://www.applegazette.com/ipod/steve-jobs-and-minimalism/">keep things simple</a>. This allowed him to create beautiful, easy-to-use objects that people intuitively knew how to use. Take the iPod: a simple rectangular device with a screen and a circular controller, any child could pick it up and understand how to use it.</p>
<p>His philosophy of minimalism didn’t only shape his design aesthetic, it also characterized his personal life. For Jobs, if something was a distraction, it had to go.</p>
<p>This gave him the quiet needed to focus on his most important tasks. Jobs’ preoccupation with simplicity went to the extreme of him having almost no furniture in his apartment. Without any superfluous clutter surrounding him, he could concentrate on what mattered.</p>
<h2><b>Ingvar Kamprad and time management</b></h2>
<p>In the early days of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad was already a master of efficiency. He started IKEA as a mail-order business from the small village of Agunnaryd in 1943, getting up at 6 AM every day.</p>
<p>To best tackle projects and finish tasks, Kamprad believed that we should all divide our lives into <a href="https://sweden.se/business/ingvar-kamprad-founder-of-ikea/" target="_blank">10 minute units</a>, and sacrifice as few of them as possible on meaningless activity.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe news of the <a title="Can tomatoes make you more productive?" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/can-tomatoes-make-you-more-productive/" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a> reached Kamprad all the way to his tiny village in rural Sweden...</p>
<h2><b>Dr. Oz and energy management</b></h2>
<p>Dr. Mehmet Oz is a busy guy. Not only does he perform 250 open-heart surgeries a year and host his own TV show, he’s also a professor, a chairman of surgery, a prolific writer, and a devoted family man with four kids.</p>
<p>His task management tip is similar to Ingvar Kamprad’s. However rather than focusing on time management, he focuses on energy management.</p>
<p>In other words, he tries to devote his time to tasks that energize and inspire him. “The things you do in your life should give you that zest for life,” he says.</p>
<p>Everybody has natural<a title="Take advantage of productivity peaks and find your daily rhythm" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/take-advantage-productivity-peaks-find-your-daily-rhythm/" target="_blank"> highs and lows of energy</a> that dictate when we work best; for some of us mornings are sacred, for others the late hours of the night are when they’re most productive. For Dr. Oz, managing his tasks well means taking these moment of high energy, maximizing them, and cutting out tasks that drag down his energy instead of boosting it.</p>
<h2><b>Darren Hardy: doing less to get ahead</b></h2>
<p>Darren Hardy - publisher, director, and mentor of CEOs and entrepreneurs - has a problem that many of us have as well. <a href="http://www.success.com/article/accomplish-more-by-doing-less" target="_blank">He’s an addict</a>.</p>
<p>So what’s his drug of choice? Not drugs or coffee or alcohol as you may think, but constant movement, constant communication, and constant achievement.</p>
<p>This addiction to perpetual busyness is one that’s all the more common among professional men and women. Caught up in a whirlwind of phone-calls, deadlines, emails, and assignments, it’s easy to <a title="4 life hacks to help you stop multitasking" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/" target="_blank">slip into the cycle of being busy but not productive</a>.</p>
<p>Darren Hardy realized that to get ahead, he can’t just keep doing more: doing so is incredibly taxing to your physical, psychological, and emotional system. Also, it’s not sustainable; sooner or later, if you don’t take a physical break, you’ll end up taking a mental one, simply going through the motions of your job without really being there.</p>
<p>So to get ahead, Hardy realized that he actually needs to start doing less. He needed to shorten his to-do list, focus on a handful of important tasks, and put the rest aside. He found ways to stop being busy and start being productive.</p>
<p>One of his strategies is using the <a title="4 life hacks to help you stop multitasking" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/multitasking-doesnt-work/">80/20 rule</a>: 20% of the work you do is responsible for 80% of your impact and effectiveness. Hardy identified the 20% and concentrated on it. The result? A more balanced lifestyle.</p>
<h2><b>President Obama and the economy of decision-making</b></h2>
<p>The brain consumes 20% more energy when it’s thinking. Over the course of a day, you make countless decisions that all require a fair amount of energy. Some of these decisions are more important. Some are fairly redundant.</p>
<p>For every decision you make, <a title="How to improve your cognitive stamina " href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/improve-cognitive-stamina/">your future decisions-making ability is eroded</a>. Psychologists call this decision fatigue. It’s the reason that judges for example give harsher rulings later on in the day.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3026265/work-smart/always-wear-the-same-suit-obamas-presidential-productivity-secrets" target="_blank">wear the same suit</a>.</p>
<p>President Obama always wears a blue or a grey suit because he doesn’t want to waste decision-making energy on what to wear. “I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make,” he says.</p>
<p>Obama uses the same type of methodical process when it comes to decision memos. Preferring written advice to spoken, he has his team members deliver memos to his desk with three checkboxes at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: url('http://nadeausoftware.com/sites/nadeausoftware.com/files/bullets/emptysquare_10x10_large.gif');">agree</li>
<li style="list-style: url('http://nadeausoftware.com/sites/nadeausoftware.com/files/bullets/emptysquare_10x10_large.gif');">disagree</li>
<li style="list-style: url('http://nadeausoftware.com/sites/nadeausoftware.com/files/bullets/emptysquare_10x10_large.gif');">let's discuss</li>
</ul>
<p>He then selects one of the boxes and communicates his choice to his team members. This process speeds up the feedback loop by breaking down decision-making into three simple choices.</p>
<p>Having a set routine for what you wear, what you eat, and how you handle other daily tasks is an amazing time-saver. It reduces the friction in your days and lets you focus on the really important decisions. When you’re working, it’s valuable; when you’re president, it’s a necessity.</p>
