  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: Like it or not, people simply suck at planning. We want to
    plan, yet most of the time our plans are turned upside down. Sometimes it&#39;s
    because of outside factors, but other times - perhaps most times - it&#39;s because
    of our own inability to estimate how long it will take to get something done.

    obsessed with it too (perhaps in an attempt to control our destiny?), yet most
    of the time our plans are turned upside down. Sometimes it''s because of outside
    factors, but other times - perhaps most times - it''s because of our own inability
    to estimate how long it will take to get something done.</p><h1>The planning fallacy</h1><p>An
    article published in 1994 in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
    by Roger Buehler and his colleagues shows how epically we fail at planning. After
    five studies were conducted on nearly 500 undergrads, the researchers found out
    that not only did the subjects underestimate their own completion times for a
    number of academic and non-academic tasks, but they also didn''t take into account
    their experiences of how a similar process happened in the past. In other words,
    they focused more on the plan and the future scenario than on what past experiences
    taught them. However, when they became observers, the opposite was true: they
    overestimated others'' completion times and considered indicative past experiences
    more.</p><p>One study by the same group of researchers, had 37 psychology students
    estimate the time it would take them to finish their theses. The average estimate
    was around 34 days. They also estimated that if everything went as well as it
    possibly could, the theses would take around 27 days, and that if everything went
    as poorly as it possibly could, it would take them around 49 days to complete
    their theses. It shouldn''t surprise you by now that only 30% of students actually
    completed their theses within the time frame they predicted. The actual average
    completion time was 55.5 days.</p><p>And that''s not all.</p><p>A survey published
    in 1997 found that Canadian taxpayers mailed in their tax forms a week later than
    they had predicted, although they were fully aware of their past record of mailing
    in forms. They had just thought they would get it done quicker next time. This
    is what the planning fallacy is all about: insisting that our current predictions
    are realistic, even though we have been overly optimistic in the past.</p><h1>We''re
    optimistic about current predictions - our ego requires it</h1><p>Roger Buehler
    and his colleagues suggest that an explanation for the planning fallacy might
    be the self-serving attributional bias in how we interpret our past experiences.
    In other words, we tend to attribute success to ourselves, while we attribute
    failures to external factors. We do this to protect ourselves and our self-esteem
    (think student who blames his bad marks on the teacher''s poor teaching skills)
    and we do it in various situations - at work, at school, in sports, in our relationships
    and even in our consumer choices. We fool ourselves into thinking that what happened
    last time was a one-off that wasn''t our fault; this time we''ll surely get everything
    done quicker.</p><h1>We don''t know enough to plan</h1><p>The truth is, it''s
    not surprising that we often think ''this time will be different''. We want it
    to be so, and those of us who are more optimistic actually believe it will be
    so. But when starting any kind of project, even though aspects of it might be
    familiar, others most probably aren''t. So when we''re planning before getting
    started on something, we know less about what we have to do than we''ll ever know
    again. This is a bad time to make decisions about when we''ll finish the project.</p><p>And
    when we make plans, working becomes about meeting those plans, not about great
    performance. We focus more on the big bad deadline staring us in the face than
    on how we''re actually doing what we do. It becomes a game of "I have to get this
    done!!"</p><h1>How can we work better?</h1><p>Here there''s something everyone
    can learn from <a title="The art of product backlog prioritization: How we manage
    our backlog" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-art-of-product-backlog-prioritization-how-we-manage-our-backlog/"
    target="_blank">agile software development</a>. Agile developers don''t work for
    months to knock down huge projects. They work in <a title="Agile planning: Your
    estimates suck" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/agile-planning-your-estimates-suck/"
    target="_blank">iterations</a>. They deliver to the customer quickly, breaking
    down big projects into smaller steps. And planning is often about "what can I
    deliver tomorrow that is valuable?" Not that agile software development doesn''t
    have a big picture in mind - it does. But it doesn''t attempt to tackle the whole
    big picture at once.</p><p>True agile developers don''t get stuck on rules either.
    They adapt to change as it comes. Because <a title="Rules that have no reason
    are just obstacles" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/rules-that-have-no-reason-are-just-obstacles/"
    target="_blank">rules that have no reason are just obstacles</a>.</p><p>Finally,
    the worst thing about making plans is that we get hung up on them. We become unresponsive
    to change and we blindly follow them, because we think that abandoning the initial
    plan means we''re somehow failing. When a plan makes you rigid to change, then
    it''s failing to be good plan.</p><p><em>We''d love to hear about your experience
