    shapes company communication</h2><p>The two principal forms of communication within
    businesses — vertical and lateral — are constantly in tension with each other,
    with the balance between them determining a company''s organizational structure. Some
    companies prefer vertical communication, with a hierarchical, top-down organizational

    is decentralized, fluid and informal. <a href="http://bpmredux.wordpress.com/about/">Theo
    Priestley</a> makes the valuable point that there is not one ideal communication
    model, rather <a title="Company culture: what we believe in" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/company-culture/">it
    has to grow organically from the company’s principles and values</a>.</p><p>The
    internal communication of a startup reflects the principles it embraces. Is it
    more disciplined? Does it encourage individual initiative? What cultural values
    have influenced its company values? What about the sector it caters to? These
    factors, and many more, impact the effectiveness of both vertical and lateral
    communication models.</p><h2>Lateral communication</h2><p><a href="http://www.sagepub.com/authorDetails.nav?contribId=532598">Michael
    J. Papa</a>, author of Organizational Communication, defines lateral (or horizontal)
    communication as “the flow of messages across functional areas at a given level
    of organization.” Sharing information across levels is encouraged, often making
    processes more efficient. People on the same level can communicate directly with
    each other instead of having to go through several levels of organization. There
    are less delays when you don’t need to go through your boss, who goes through
    his, who contacts another department, before you finally speak with the relevant
    person.</p><p>Focusing on lateral communication, a company places more emphasis
    on facilitating cooperation than on directing work. When a company grows in size,
    lateral communication is a good way of keeping a feeling of unity and having all
    parts of it work towards the same goals. ￼</p>[caption id="attachment_1726" align="aligncenter"

    alt="" width="650" height="160" /></a> lateral communication across managerial
    levels[/caption]<h2>Informal interactions are important, too</h2><p>Firms that
    embrace lateral communication often have more flexible structures. While great
    emphasis is placed on its formal aspects, it’s important to also remember the
    informal aspects. Horizontal communication can come in the shape of meetings between
    departments, but also in the guise of conversations by the coffeemaker.</p><p>In
    fact, the conversation may not be related to your work at all. Even if you’re
    talking about your best friend’s cousin’s cat or the wedding you went to last
    weekend, such conversations can have the potential to indirectly impact your work
    in a positive way. If you are on friendly terms with those in and outside of your
    department, it is often easier to ask them for help. You will know who to turn
    to when you encounter a particular issue. The result? Problems are resolved faster.</p><h2>Vertical
    communication</h2><p>When vertical communication is prioritized, there is more
    communication between upper and lower levels than there is between team members
    on the same organizational level. This type of top-down, organized communication
    is typical of organizations with strict and visible hierarchies.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>Both
    vertical and lateral communication is needed for an organization to work effectively;
    yet both also have their drawbacks. Lateral communication can result in tension
    between rivalrous departments, disputed leadership, or in time being wasted on informal
    interactions that lead team members off-topic. Vertical communication can result
    in ineffective team management as its strict structure discourages individual
    team members from taking initiative. With disconnected departments that work in
    a top-down, bottom-up fashion, asking for help often generates the answer “it’s
    not in my budget” or “it’s not in my objectives.”</p><h2>Steve Denning: why lateral
    communication is good for tech startups</h2><p>While countless factors impact
    the way a company communicates, one trend that Steve Denning brought to light
    in his Forbes article was the stark organizational difference between <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/05/01/leadership-in-the-three-speed-economy/">the
    creative economy and the traditional economy</a>.</p><p>The traditional economy
    is made up of firms with big hierarchical bureaucracies and have a structure where
    vertical communication is prioritized. However, with huge technological change
    occurring from the 1960s onwards and the emergence of computers, the Web and mobile
    phones, communication has not only changed in terms of speed: greater structural
    changes have also occurred that have resulted in a shift from vertical value chains
    to horizontal value chains. These are the ones that characterize the creative
    economy, pioneered by giants like Google, Apple and a thousand innovative startups.</p><p>As
    customers gain access to instant and reliable information, their demands start
    to change. They want something <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/05/09/is-the-creative-economy-also-in-trouble/">cheaper,
    faster and personalized</a>. With the growing popularity of SaaS and cloud-based
    software like Dropbox, Google Docs, and task management tools like Sandglaz, customers can
    create their own virtual meeting spaces and marketplaces. They can share ideas
    and products in a structure that all of a sudden has grown increasingly fluid.</p><p>Denning
    argues that in an environment where customers constantly demand personalized and
    interactive solutions, firms with rigid vertical communication structures are
    unable to respond quickly to customer demands. Instead, collaborative enterprises
    thrive. Why buy a CD when you can pick and choose the songs you want to listen
    to on Spotify? Why buy a bulky, expensive, soon-out-of-date copy of the Encyclopedia
    Britannica when you can use Wikipedia for free?</p><p>Denning argues that not
    only do many of these services have the perfect price - they cost little or are
    free - “they are also much, much better.” Constantly updated by thousands of users,
    they are available to anyone with an Internet connection and are accessible without
    physically having to seek out a store.</p><p>These services have become available
    as startups embrace flexible, horizontal structures. Enabling continuous innovation
    and fast response, this is how 21st century startups should work. Vertical hierarchies
    belong in the past.</p><h2>Maybe Denning is wrong: the limits of lateral communication</h2><p>While
    Denning argues that a more flexible, horizontal communication structure is the
    one that is suited to the demands of our time, a <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?chapterid=17000016">study
    in 2011</a> showed that lateral communication has no visible impact on the performance
    of a firm. In their report <em>The Effects of Formalisation, Hierarchical Decentralisation
    and Lateral Communication: Strategic Decision-Making Processes on SME International
    Performance</em>, Pavlos Dimitratos and his co-authors investigated 528 small
    and medium enterprises in the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece and Cyprus,
    looking at the relationship between three strategic decision-making processes
    and their international performance. They also looked at the role of dynamism
    on the process.</p><p>These three strategic decision-making processes were formalization,
    hierarchical decentralization and lateral communication.</p><h2>What they found</h2><p>Formalization
    and decentralization have a positive effect on international performance. Lateral
    communication, on the other hand, has no effect. They did however find evidence
    supporting that lateral communication produces positive effects in dynamic business
    settings.</p><h2>Should you embrace or reject lateral communication? Go back to
    your company culture</h2><p>Ultimately, each startup is unique in its structure
    and the effects lateral communication have on each one are also unique. If you
    choose to embrace lateral communication, or opt for a more vertical model, keep
    in mind Theo Priestley’s words about values and principles: your communication
    model must compliment these values, not clash with it. The same communication
    techniques, when applied to different startups, will produce different results.
    Perhaps, like Dimitratos, Thanos, Petrou and Papadikis found, lateral communication
    has no measurable effect on your company’s success. Or, like Denning investigated,
    lateral communication is what gives you the flexibility to consistently respond
    to changing customer demands.</p><p>We would argue that in an age where there
    is all the more pressure for entrepreneurs to provide solutions that are better,
    simpler and different, lateral communication, more than any vertical model, gives
    you the tools to be flexible, innovative and ultimately successful.</p><p><strong><em>Has
    lateral communication improved the way your team works? Join the conversation

<p>Firms that embrace lateral communication often have more flexible structures. While great emphasis is placed on its formal aspects, it’s important to also remember the informal aspects. Horizontal communication can come in the shape of meetings between departments, but also in the guise of conversations by the coffeemaker.</p>
<p>In fact, the conversation may not be related to your work at all. Even if you’re talking about your best friend’s cousin’s cat or the wedding you went to last weekend, such conversations can have the potential to indirectly impact your work in a positive way. If you are on friendly terms with those in and outside of your department, it is often easier to ask them for help. You will know who to turn to when you encounter a particular issue. The result? Problems are resolved faster.</p>
<h2>Vertical communication</h2>
<p>When vertical communication is prioritized, there is more communication between upper and lower levels than there is between team members on the same organizational level. This type of top-down, organized communication is typical of organizations with strict and visible hierarchies.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Both vertical and lateral communication is needed for an organization to work effectively; yet both also have their drawbacks. Lateral communication can result in tension between rivalrous departments, disputed leadership, or in time being wasted on informal interactions that lead team members off-topic. Vertical communication can result in ineffective team management as its strict structure discourages individual team members from taking initiative. With disconnected departments that work in a top-down, bottom-up fashion, asking for help often generates the answer “it’s not in my budget” or “it’s not in my objectives.”</p>
<h2>Steve Denning: why lateral communication is good for tech startups</h2>
<p>While countless factors impact the way a company communicates, one trend that Steve Denning brought to light in his Forbes article was the stark organizational difference between <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/05/01/leadership-in-the-three-speed-economy/">the creative economy and the traditional economy</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional economy is made up of firms with big hierarchical bureaucracies and have a structure where vertical communication is prioritized. However, with huge technological change occurring from the 1960s onwards and the emergence of computers, the Web and mobile phones, communication has not only changed in terms of speed: greater structural changes have also occurred that have resulted in a shift from vertical value chains to horizontal value chains. These are the ones that characterize the creative economy, pioneered by giants like Google, Apple and a thousand innovative startups.</p>
<p>As customers gain access to instant and reliable information, their demands start to change. They want something <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/05/09/is-the-creative-economy-also-in-trouble/">cheaper, faster and personalized</a>. With the growing popularity of SaaS and cloud-based software like Dropbox, Google Docs, and task management tools like Sandglaz, customers can create their own virtual meeting spaces and marketplaces. They can share ideas and products in a structure that all of a sudden has grown increasingly fluid.</p>
<p>Denning argues that in an environment where customers constantly demand personalized and interactive solutions, firms with rigid vertical communication structures are unable to respond quickly to customer demands. Instead, collaborative enterprises thrive. Why buy a CD when you can pick and choose the songs you want to listen to on Spotify? Why buy a bulky, expensive, soon-out-of-date copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica when you can use Wikipedia for free?</p>
<p>Denning argues that not only do many of these services have the perfect price - they cost little or are free - “they are also much, much better.” Constantly updated by thousands of users, they are available to anyone with an Internet connection and are accessible without physically having to seek out a store.</p>
<p>These services have become available as startups embrace flexible, horizontal structures. Enabling continuous innovation and fast response, this is how 21st century startups should work. Vertical hierarchies belong in the past.</p>
<h2>Maybe Denning is wrong: the limits of lateral communication</h2>
<p>While Denning argues that a more flexible, horizontal communication structure is the one that is suited to the demands of our time, a <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?chapterid=17000016">study in 2011</a> showed that lateral communication has no visible impact on the performance of a firm. In their report <em>The Effects of Formalisation, Hierarchical Decentralisation and Lateral Communication: Strategic Decision-Making Processes on SME International Performance</em>, Pavlos Dimitratos and his co-authors investigated 528 small and medium enterprises in the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece and Cyprus, looking at the relationship between three strategic decision-making processes and their international performance. They also looked at the role of dynamism on the process.</p>
<p>These three strategic decision-making processes were formalization, hierarchical decentralization and lateral communication.</p>
<h2>What they found</h2>
<p>Formalization and decentralization have a positive effect on international performance. Lateral communication, on the other hand, has no effect. They did however find evidence supporting that lateral communication produces positive effects in dynamic business settings.</p>
<h2>Should you embrace or reject lateral communication? Go back to your company culture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, each startup is unique in its structure and the effects lateral communication have on each one are also unique. If you choose to embrace lateral communication, or opt for a more vertical model, keep in mind Theo Priestley’s words about values and principles: your communication model must compliment these values, not clash with it. The same communication techniques, when applied to different startups, will produce different results. Perhaps, like Dimitratos, Thanos, Petrou and Papadikis found, lateral communication has no measurable effect on your company’s success. Or, like Denning investigated, lateral communication is what gives you the flexibility to consistently respond to changing customer demands.</p>
<p>We would argue that in an age where there is all the more pressure for entrepreneurs to provide solutions that are better, simpler and different, lateral communication, more than any vertical model, gives you the tools to be flexible, innovative and ultimately successful.</p>
