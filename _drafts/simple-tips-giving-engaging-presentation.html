<p>This is a <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/guest-blogging/">guest post</a> by <a href="https://www.tp3.com.au/leaders-knowledge-and-productivity-improvement">Sophia Driver</a>.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur or small business leader, you should be eager to make the most of every opportunity to expand your horizons. Aside from enrolling in business management courses and training to improve your skills and knowledge, you need to develop <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/5-essential-communication-skills-you-need-in-the-workplace/">communication abilities</a> so you will be capable of giving an engaging presentation.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have years of public speaking experience and expertise under your belt, you can still be an effective communicator. That is, if you heed the following basic guidelines.</p>
<h2><!--more--></h2>
<h2>Tell your audience about the purpose of your presentation</h2>
<p>Make sure your audience knows what they will get from your talk. It’s always a good idea to prepare a quick overview that details the important points you will be discussing and the reasons why your audience should listen.</p>
<h2>Use silence to your advantage</h2>
<p>To establish a connection with your audience members, you need to be mindful of their reactions.</p>
<p>Don’t throw around sentences and paragraphs without giving them a chance to catch everything you’re saying. You need to give them time to react. Pause after your statements so everyone can absorb information and participate more actively.</p>
<h2>Don’t use more time than you need</h2>
<p>Keep your presentation clear, informative and concise. That way, you won’t go beyond your allotted time, and your audience will not feel any semblance of boredom. What’s more, they will surely be grateful that you value their time.</p>
<h2>Enumerate, explain and emphasize</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2012/02/06/presentation-skills-bring-statistics-to-life/">Using numbers in a presentation</a> is a proven way to keep the audience attentive. Your listeners will surely pay attention better when you enumerate your points, explain them thoroughly and emphasize keywords.</p>
<h2>Be a storyteller</h2>
<p>Everyone loves hearing stories, especially anecdotes that are filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Telling a story or two during your presentation can make your points more relatable so your presentation will not be bland, lifeless and boring. Whether you choose a serious personal anecdote or a humorous tale you heard from a colleague, make sure it is about something that will interest your audience.</p>
<h2>Surprise your audience</h2>
<p>Give your presentation a unique twist by doing something the audience would never expect. For example, you can stop talking when you’re halfway done, close your <a href="https://www.tp3.com.au/courselist_it/excel-training-courses">Excel file</a>, and ask some questions. Encourage everyone in the audience to participate and provide you with <a href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-art-of-asking-for-feedback-at-work/">honest feedback</a>. There’s no need to worry if they don’t agree with some of the points you have presented, because <a title="Why being a little disagreeable is important for entrepreneurs" href="http://blog.sandglaz.com/why-being-a-little-disagreeable-is-important-for-entrepreneurs/">being a little disagreeable is a good thing for entrepreneurs</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, you need to be motivated and excited about your presentation. Do your best to make it as interesting and captivating as you can, and everything else will follow suit.</p>
