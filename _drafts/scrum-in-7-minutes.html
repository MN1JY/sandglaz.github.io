<p>Scrum is a radical new approach for planning and managing projects. With scrum, projects progress in a series of iterations called sprints, where each sprint is 2-4 weeks long. The small rapid iterations allow teams to pause, reflect, learn and change direction if need be. Hence, scrum is ideal for projects with rapid changing requirements; and it gained special momentum in software development projects.</p>
<p>Scrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. There is no leader in scrum, instead a team that can work together from idea to implementation. The team should include one person who represents the customer, this person is called the product owner. In scrum, the commitment and strength of the team is the difference between success and failure.</p>
<h3>The Scrum Product Backlog</h3>
<p><img class="right" title="Example Product Backlog" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></p>
<p>The scrum product backlog is a list of functionality that remains to be added to the product. It is prioritized by the product owner. The best way to populate the product backlog is by writing short descriptions of functionality from the perspective of the customer.</p>
<h3>The Sprint Backlog</h3>
<p>On the first day of a sprint, team members create a sprint backlog. It's the to-do list of the sprint. Whereas a product backlog is the list of features to be built, the sprint backlog is the list of tasks that the team needs to perform in a given sprint to deliver the functionality they committed to for that sprint.</p>
<h3>Setting up Sandglaz</h3>
<p>Create an <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com/pages/videos#infinity_grids">Infinity grid</a> with 1 row, and bi-weekly <a href="http://www.sandglaz.com/pages/videos#adjusting_milestones">milestones</a>. Give the grid a name e.g. Medical Site, and share it with all team members. The product owner should then populate the "Later" column with the list of features to be built in the order of priority. The image above is an example Product Backlog populated in the Later column of the Medical Site grid.</p>
<h3>Sprint Planning Meeting</h3>
<p><img class="right" title="Example Sprint Backlog" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/large.png" /></p>
<p>Before the beginning of a sprint, the team meets and the product owner describes the highest priority features to the team. The team asks enough questions that they can turn the high level features into detailed tasks. Together they decide what is reasonable to accomplish in the next sprint, and they agree on the sprint goal and the sprint backlog. Whereas the sprint goal is a one sentence high level goal like implement practitioner application, the sprint backlog is the detailed tasks that each team member needs to accomplish to reach that goal. During the meeting they populate the current milestone in the grid with the sprint backlog and assign the tasks. The image to the right is an example sprint backlog populated in the current milestone of the Medical Site grid.</p>
<h3>The Sprint</h3>
<p>During the sprint team members execute those tasks and mark them completed as they go.</p>
<h3>Sprint Review Meeting</h3>
<p>In a sprint review meeting the team gets together to demo the new features. Participants can include management and customers, but the meeting is intentionally kept informal, no powerpoint slides and no preparation time for the meeting. It must not be a distraction or detour for the team, rather, it should be a natural result of the sprint.</p>
<h3>Retrospective Meeting</h3>
<p>Commonly done right after the sprint review meeting. The team gets together and identify specific things that they should:</p>
<ul>
<li>start doing</li>
<li>stop doing</li>
<li>continue doing</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to have the team constantly looking for opportunities of improvement and acting on them.</p>
