<p>People are what make companies succeed. Building a team of people who are skilled and work well together is what it's all about. This is not an easy thing to do and it requires a good set of skills (hiring, managing, motivating …etc.) that I won't be able to fit into one blog post, but I'll start with some team building activities. People who like each other work better together, and team building activities can help your team bond.</p>
<p>Here are four team building activities that you can try out:</p>
<h3>Two truths and a lie</h3>
<p>Each person will introduce him- or herself by stating two truths about their life and one lie. The rest of the team will guess which statement is the lie. For example a person might say "Hi, I'm Mary. My hair was almost to my waist in high school, I talked to Cher in an airport coffee shop, and I speak four languages."</p>
<h3>Eleven eleven</h3>
<p>After a shot of whiskey, each person shares a low and a high of their past week.</p>
<p>I was introduced to this at TechStars Seattle. We do this every Wednesday at 11:11pm, hence the name "eleven eleven".</p>
<h3>Werewolf</h3>
<p>Werewolf takes place in a small village which is hunted by werewolves. Each person is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or Seer (a special Villager). There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager, who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining players then discuss and vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. The player reveals his/her role and is out of the game. Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves.</p>
<h3>Personal Logos</h3>
<p>Each person takes a piece of paper and makes his or her own personal logo. After the logos are done, each person explains their logos. This allows everyone to understand their team members on a personal level and promotes self awareness.</p>
<p>You can also make up your own activities. For successful team building, make sure the activities you choose are not competitive and make sure to do something on a regular basis. Once a week is a good cadence. For example, going to the bar every Friday can work pretty well as well.</p>
