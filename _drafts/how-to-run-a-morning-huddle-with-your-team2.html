<p><b>A morning huddle with your team can be the single most effective meeting that you have with your team.</b></p>
<p>The purpose of a morning team huddle is to check-in with your team about what your day or week will be looking like.</p>
<p>Your goal in the huddle is not to plan your week or projects -- <i>that's what all the other meetings on your calendar are for</i>.</p>
<p>Effective morning huddles are 'information sharing' meetings that delivers status checks from individuals to the rest of their team.</p>
<p>Here are a few ground rules to run successful morning huddles.</p>
<h3>STANDING ONLY</h3>
<p>As soon as people sit down around a table, they get into 'meeting mode'.</p>
<p>Meeting mode spurs debate and discussion which are great for planning, but are disruptive for when you just need to communicate status updates.</p>
<p>To run an effective huddle, ditch the meeting rooms and run a standing-only huddle right in your team's existing workspace.</p>
<h3>ALL TEAM MEMBERS SPEAK</h3>
<p>Ask each person on your team to share during the huddle.<br />
<b>Vocalizing individual status updates to your team creates greater commitment and task accountability.</b></p>
<p>If your company is too big (20+) to allow for individual updates in a 15-minute standup, then it's time to break off your huddles into departments or teams.</p>
<h3>THE SHORTER THE BETTER</h3>
<p>Under 15 minutes is great. Under 10 minutes and you're crushing it.<br />
If huddles turn into 45 minute discussions, then you'll start to get a lot of glazed over looks from everyone who doesn't need to be part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Try scheduling your standups right before lunchtime (11:45am). Your team will have extra incentive to wrap things up quickly.</p>
<h3>NO PROBLEM SOLVING</h3>
<p>Why? Because problem solving requires debate, discussion, and review of all options. Schedule a separate meeting with others.<br />
Prioritize information sharing instead of consensus building or debate.</p>
<p>If the meeting takes a turn toward discussion, quickly interject and suggest that folks debating a topic need to schedule a separate time to talk. Then ask for the next person's update.</p>
<h3>WHAT TO SAY</h3>
<p>Since the purpose of the huddle is to check-in with your team. What should you actually share during a huddle?</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you accomplish last week?</li>
<li>Top 3 priorities for the day/week.</li>
<li>Review your company or team's top 3 metrics.</li>
<li>Share roadblocks that you need help in (important: teammates should help AFTER your huddle, not during).</li>
<li>Recognize other team member accomplishments.</li>
<li>Share personal project wins.</li>
<li>Client updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Do not try and communicate all of these things during your huddle.</b></p>
<p>Start with just 2 or 3 of these items and ask your team to stick to them.</p>
<p>If you're initiating a morning huddle routine with your team, then lead the huddle by delivering a short, crisp status update to set the tone.</p>
<p>Building a morning huddle ritual will help make your team more effective by getting your team to vocalize what they're working on to their colleagues.</p>
<p>It also gives everyone a chance to know what's keeping everyone busy and should add depth beyond what your team task management tool is giving you.</p>
<p><b>How do you run your morning huddles? Any tips to share on making them effective? Do you do huddles weekly or daily with your team?</b></p>
